GROUP WORK - 2pts
PRESENTATION:
  PRESENTED TO: Jack, Gonzalo, Angel

I presented a gui to my group that was my small project.
The gui has a user enter text and then click submit. 
It then analyzes the text and outputs a score.
You can continue to add to the text and the gui will take an average of all of the scores.
