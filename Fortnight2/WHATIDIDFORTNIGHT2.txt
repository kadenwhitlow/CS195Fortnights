Located at the bottom of the Markov Models notebook.

I created a program that lets a user choose what type of story they want to write, from 6 different genres.
Then trains a model based on story data from the chosen genre dataset.

Then it asks the user to start typing the story they want to create! 
When the user is done writing their story is completed automatically by the model.

The full story is then generated.
