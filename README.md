  PRESENTED TO: Jack, Gonzalo, Angel

WHAT I DID:

SMALL PROJECT - 5pts
The gui has a user enter text and then click submit. 
It then analyzes the text and outputs a score.
You can continue to add to the text and the gui will take an average of all of the scores.

Creative Synthesis: 5PTS
F2_4_MarkovModels.ipynb

Located at the bottom of the Markov Models notebook.

I created a program that lets a user choose what type of story they want to write, from 6 different genres.
Then trains a model based on story data from the chosen genre dataset.

Then it asks the user to start typing the story they want to create! 
When the user is done writing their story is completed automatically by the model.

The full story is then generated.
