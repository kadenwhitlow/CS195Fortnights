# CS195Fortnights


This is my GITHUB for every Fortnight in the course:

It is split up into folders and has each notebook for every fortnight.

There is more information in the text files for every folder.

## PROJECTED POINTS EARNED:

# Fortnight 1
5xp - Core Practice
5xp - Applied Exploration
5xp - Small Project

POINTS EXPECTED: 17xp

PRESENTATION:
  PRESENTED TO: Jack, Gonzalo, Angel

WHAT I DID:

SMALL PROJECT - 5pts
The gui has a user enter text and then click submit. 
It then analyzes the text and outputs a score.
You can continue to add to the text and the gui will take an average of all of the scores.

  PRESENTED TO: Jack, Gonzalo, Angel

I presented a gui to my group that was my small project.
The gui has a user enter text and then click submit. 
It then analyzes the text and outputs a score.
You can continue to add to the text and the gui will take an average of all of the scores.

# Fortnight 2
5xp - Core Practice
5xp - Applied Exploration
5xp - Small Project

POINTS EXPECTED: 15xp

GROUP: Gonzalo, Jack, Angel


Core Practice: 5PTS
F2_1_MoreOnDatasets.ipynb
F2_2_SummarizationTranslationQuestionAnswering.ipynb
F2_3_QuestionAnswering.ipynb
F2_4_MarkovModels.ipynb


Applied Explorations: 5PTS
F2_3_QuestionAnswering.ipynb
F2_4_MarkovModels.ipynb


Creative Synthesis: 5PTS
F2_4_MarkovModels.ipynb

Located at the bottom of the Markov Models notebook.

I loaded different genres of stories from HuggingFace datasets and then trained the Markov model on them, then I improved the model so it would base predictions on multiple words. This allowed the user to choose what type of story they want to write, from 6 different genres.
Then trains a model based on story data from the chosen genre dataset.
Then it asks the user to start typing the story they want to create! 
When the user is done writing their story is completed automatically by the model.
The full story is then generated.

5xp - Applied Exploration
5xp - Small Project
GROUP: Gabe, Cooper, Mack

WHAT I PRESENTED:

I presented the small project matching game I created! The description of the game is below.

POINTS EXPECTED: 15xp

  DESCRIPTION: I made a small project that is a matching game, where the WordNet library is used 
  and the board is generated based on synonyms of words.
