            ". Referring to himself as a \"consulting detective\" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, deduction, forensic science and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.\n",
            "First appearing in print in 1887's A Study in Scarlet, the character's popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one[a] are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer Dr. John H. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.\n",
            "Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known.[1] By the 1990s, there were already over 25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions and publications featuring the detective,[2] and Guinness World Records lists him as the most portrayed human literary character in film and television history.[3] Holmes's popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual;[4][5][6] numerous literary and fan societies have been founded on this pretence. Avid readers of the Holmes stories helped create the modern practice of fandom.[7] The character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.\n",

            "Inspiration for the character\n",
            "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930), Sherlock Holmes's creator, in 1914\n",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's C. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction and served as the prototype for many later characters, including Holmes.[8] Conan Doyle once wrote, \"Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed ... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\"[9] Similarly, the stories of Émile Gaboriau's Monsieur Lecoq were extremely popular at the time Conan Doyle began writing Holmes, and Holmes's speech and behaviour sometimes follow those of Lecoq.[10][11] Doyle has his main characters discuss these literary antecedents near the beginning of A Study in Scarlet, which is set soon after Watson is first introduced to Holmes. Watson attempts to compliment Holmes by comparing him to Dupin, to which Holmes replies that he found Dupin to be \"a very inferior fellow\" and Lecoq to be \"a miserable bungler\".[12]\n",
            "Conan Doyle repeatedly said that Holmes was inspired by the real-life figure of Joseph Bell, a surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, whom Conan Doyle met in 1877 and had worked for as a clerk. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing broad conclusions from minute observations.[13] However, he later wrote to Conan Doyle: \"You are yourself Sherlock Holmes and well you know it\".[14] Sir Henry Littlejohn, Chair of Medical Jurisprudence at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, is also cited as an inspiration for Holmes. Littlejohn, who was also Police Surgeon and Medical Officer of Health in Edinburgh, provided Conan Doyle with a link between medical investigation and the detection of crime.[15]\n",
            "Other possible inspirations have been proposed, though never acknowledged by Doyle, such as Maximilien Heller, by French author Henry Cauvain. In this 1871 novel (sixteen years before the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes), Henry Cauvain imagined a depressed, anti-social, opium-smoking polymath detective, operating in Paris.[16][17][18] It is not known if Conan Doyle read the novel, but he was fluent in French.[19] Similarly, Michael Harrison suggested that a German self-styled \"consulting detective\" named Walter Scherer may have been the model for Holmes.[20]\n",

In \"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\", he claims that his grandmother was sister to the French artist Vernet, without clarifying whether this was Claude Joseph, Carle, or Horace Vernet. Holmes's brother Mycroft, seven years his senior, is a government official. Mycroft has a unique civil service position as a kind of human database for all aspects of government policy.

Holmes frequently calls Watson's records of Holmes's cases sensational and populist, suggesting that they fail to accurately and objectively report the \"science\" of his craft:\n",
            "\n",
            "Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it [A Study in Scarlet] with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid. ... Some facts should be suppressed, or, at least, a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes, by which I succeeded in unravelling it.[29]\n",
            "Nevertheless, when Holmes recorded a case himself, he was forced to concede that he could more easily understand the need to write it in a manner that would appeal to the public rather than his intention to focus on his own technical skill.[30]\n",

The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.[31]\n",

He is known only in select professional circles at the beginning of the first story, but is already collaborating with Scotland Yard. However, his continued work and the publication of Watson's stories raise Holmes's profile, and he rapidly becomes well known as a detective; so many clients ask for his help instead of (or in addition to) that of the police[32] that, Watson writes, by 1887 \"Europe was ringing with his name\"[33] and by 1895 Holmes has \"an immense practice\".[34] Police outside London ask Holmes for assistance if he is nearby.[35] A Prime Minister[36] and the King of Bohemia[37] visit 221B Baker Street in person to request Holmes's assistance; the President of France awards him the Legion of Honour for capturing an assassin;[38] the King of Scandinavia is a client;[39] and he aids the Vatican at least twice.[40] The detective acts on behalf of the British government in matters of national security several times,[41] and declines a knighthood \"for services which may perhaps some day be described\".[42] However, he does not actively seek fame and is usually content to let the police take public credit for his work.[43]\n",

            "The first set of Holmes stories was published between 1887 and 1893. Conan Doyle killed off Holmes in a final battle with the criminal mastermind Professor James Moriarty[44] in \"The Final Problem\" (published 1893, but set in 1891), as Conan Doyle felt that \"my literary energies should not be directed too much into one channel.\"[45] However, the reaction of the public surprised Doyle very much. Distressed readers wrote anguished letters to The Strand Magazine, which suffered a terrible blow when 20,000 people cancelled their subscriptions to the magazine in protest.[46] Conan Doyle himself received many protest letters, and one lady even began her letter with \"You brute\".[46] Legend has it that Londoners were so distraught upon hearing the news of Holmes's death that they wore black armbands in mourning, though there is no known contemporary source for this; the earliest known reference to such events comes from 1949.[47] However, the recorded public reaction to Holmes's death was unlike anything previously seen for fictional events.[7]\n",
            "After resisting public pressure for eight years, Conan Doyle wrote The Hound of the Baskervilles (serialised in 1901–02, with an implicit setting before Holmes's death). In 1903, Conan Doyle wrote \"The Adventure of the Empty House\"; set in 1894, Holmes reappears, explaining to a stunned Watson that he had faked his death to fool his enemies.[48] Following \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", Conan Doyle would sporadically write new Holmes stories until 1927.\n",
            "Holmes aficionados refer to the period from 1891 to 1894—between his disappearance and presumed death in \"The Final Problem\" and his reappearance in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\"—as the Great Hiatus.[49] The earliest known use of this expression dates to 1946.[50]\n",

Only one other adventure, \"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\", takes place during the detective's retirement.[53]\n",

            "Watson describes Holmes as \"bohemian\" in his habits and lifestyle.[54] Said to have a \"cat-like\" love of personal cleanliness,[55] at the same time Holmes is an eccentric with no regard for contemporary standards of tidiness or good order. Watson describes him as\n",
            "\n",
            "in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. [He] keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece. ... He had a horror of destroying documents.... Thus month after month his papers accumulated, until every corner of the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by their owner.[56]\n",
            "While Holmes can be dispassionate and cold, during an investigation he is animated and excitable. He has a flair for showmanship, often keeping his methods and evidence hidden until the last possible moment so as to impress observers.[57] His companion condones the detective's willingness to bend the truth (or break the law) on behalf of a client—lying to the police, concealing evidence or breaking into houses—when he feels it morally justifiable.[58]\n",
            "Except for that of Watson, Holmes avoids casual company. In \"The Gloria Scott\", he tells the doctor that during two years at college he made only one friend: \"I was never a very sociable fellow, Watson ... I never mixed much with the men of my year\".[59] The detective goes without food at times of intense intellectual activity, believing that \"the faculties become refined when you starve them.\"[60][61] At times Holmes relaxes with music, either playing the violin,[62] or enjoying the works of composers such as Wagner[63] and Pablo de Sarasate.[64]\n",

            "Watson and Holmes both use tobacco, smoking cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. Although his chronicler does not consider Holmes's smoking a vice per se, Watson—a physician—does criticise the detective for creating a \"poisonous atmosphere\" in their confined quarters.[72][73]\n",

The detective states at one point that \"My professional charges are upon a fixed scale. I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether\". In this context, a client is offering to double his fee, and it is implied that wealthy clients habitually pay Holmes more than his standard rate.[74] In \"The Adventure of the Priory School\", Holmes earns a £6,000 fee[75] (at a time where annual expenses for a rising young professional were in the area of £500).[76] However, Watson notes that Holmes would refuse to help even the wealthy and powerful if their cases did not interest him.[77]\n",
            "\n",
            "Attitudes towards women\n",
            "As Conan Doyle wrote to Joseph Bell, \"Holmes is as inhuman as a Babbage's Calculating Machine and just about as likely to fall in love\".[78] Holmes says of himself that he is \"not a whole-souled admirer of womankind\",[79] and that he finds \"the motives of women ... inscrutable. ... How can you build on such quicksand? Their most trivial actions may mean volumes...\"[80] In The Sign of Four, he says, \"Women are never to be entirely trusted—not the best of them\", a feeling Watson notes as an \"atrocious sentiment\".[81] In \"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\", Holmes writes, \"Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart\".[82] At the end of The Sign of Four, Holmes states that \"love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true, cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgement.\"[83] Ultimately, Holmes claims outright that \"I have never loved\".[84]\n",
            "But while Watson says that the detective has an \"aversion to women\",[85] he also notes Holmes as having \"a peculiarly ingratiating way with [them]\".[86] Watson notes that their housekeeper Mrs. Hudson is fond of Holmes because of his \"remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always a chivalrous opponent\".[87] However, in \"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\", the detective becomes engaged under false pretenses in order to obtain information about a case, abandoning the woman once he has the information he requires.[88]\n",

Although this is her only appearance, she is one of only a handful of people who best Holmes in a battle of wits, and the only woman. For this reason, Adler is the frequent subject of pastiche writing.[89] The beginning of the story describes the high regard in which Holmes holds her:\n",
            "\n",
            "To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. ... And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.[90]\n",
            "Five years before the story's events, Adler had a brief liaison with Crown Prince of Bohemia Wilhelm von Ormstein. As the story opens, the Prince is engaged to another. Fearful that the marriage would be called off if his fiancée's family learns of this past impropriety, Ormstein hires Holmes to regain a photograph of Adler and himself. Adler slips away before Holmes can succeed. Her memory is kept alive by the photograph of Adler that Holmes received for his part in the case.[91]\n",

            "In A Study in Scarlet, Holmes claims to be unaware that the Earth revolves around the Sun since such information is irrelevant to his work; after hearing that fact from Watson, he says he will immediately try to forget it. The detective believes that the mind has a finite capacity for information storage, and learning useless things reduces one's ability to learn useful things.[93] The later stories move away from this notion: in The Valley of Fear, he says, \"All knowledge comes useful to the detective\",[94] and in \"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\", the detective calls himself \"an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles\".[95] Looking back on the development of the character in 1912, Conan Doyle wrote that \"In the first one, the Study in Scarlet, [Holmes] was a mere calculating machine, but I had to make him more of an educated human being as I went on with him.\"[96]\n",
            "Despite Holmes's supposed ignorance of politics, in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" he immediately recognises the true identity of the disguised \"Count von Kramm\".[37] At the end of A Study in Scarlet, Holmes demonstrates a knowledge of Latin.[97] The detective cites Hafez,[98] Goethe,[99] as well as a letter from Gustave Flaubert to George Sand in the original French.[100] In The Hound of the Baskervilles, the detective recognises works by Godfrey Kneller and Joshua Reynolds: \"Watson won't allow that I know anything of art, but that is mere jealousy since our views upon the subject differ\".[101] In \"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\", Watson says that \"Holmes lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus\", considered \"the last word\" on the subject—which must have been the result of an intensive and very specialized musicological study which could have had no possible application to the solution of criminal mysteries.[102][103]\n",
            "Holmes is a cryptanalyst, telling Watson that \"I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writing, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject, in which I analyse one hundred and sixty separate ciphers\".[104] Holmes also demonstrates a knowledge of psychology in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", luring Irene Adler into betraying where she hid a photograph based on the premise that a woman will rush to save her most valued possession from a fire.[105] Another example is in \"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\", where Holmes obtains information from a salesman with a wager: \"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet .... I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager\".[106]\n",
            "Maria Konnikova points out in an interview with D. J. Grothe that Holmes practises what is now called mindfulness, concentrating on one thing at a time, and almost never \"multitasks\". She adds that in this he predates the science showing how helpful this is to the brain.[107]\n",

            "Holmes observes the dress and attitude of his clients and suspects, noting skin marks (such as tattoos), contamination (such as ink stains or clay on boots), emotional state, and physical condition in order to deduce their origins and recent history. The style and state of wear of a person's clothes and personal items are also commonly relied on; in the stories Holmes is seen applying his method to items such as walking sticks,[108] pipes,[109] and hats.[110] For example, in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", Holmes infers that Watson had got wet lately and had \"a most clumsy and careless servant girl\". When Watson asks how Holmes knows this, the detective answers:\n",
            "\n",
            "It is simplicity itself ... my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey.[111]\n",
            "In the first Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet, Dr. Watson compares Holmes to C. Auguste Dupin, Edgar Allan Poe's fictional detective, who employed a similar methodology. Alluding to an episode in \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\", where Dupin determines what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together in silence for a quarter of an hour, Holmes remarks: \"That trick of his breaking in on his friend's thoughts with an apropos remark... is really very showy and superficial\".[112] Nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same 'trick' on Watson in \"The Cardboard Box\"[113] and \"The Adventure of the Dancing Men\".[114]\n",
            "Though the stories always refer to Holmes's intellectual detection method as \"deduction\", he primarily relies on abduction: inferring an explanation for observed details.[115][116][117] \"From a drop of water\", he writes, \"a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other\".[118] However, Holmes does employ deductive reasoning as well. The detective's guiding principle, as he says in The Sign of Four, is: \"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\"[119]\n",
            "Despite Holmes's remarkable reasoning abilities, Conan Doyle still paints him as fallible in this regard (this being a central theme of \"The Yellow Face\").[120]\n",

            "19th-century Seibert microscope\n",
            "Though Holmes is famed for his reasoning capabilities, his investigative technique relies heavily on the acquisition of hard evidence. Many of the techniques he employs in the stories were at the time in their infancy.[121][122]\n",
            "The detective is particularly skilled in the analysis of trace evidence and other physical evidence, including latent prints (such as footprints, hoof prints, and shoe and tire impressions) to identify actions at a crime scene;[123] using tobacco ashes and cigarette butts to identify criminals;[124] handwriting analysis and graphology;[125] comparing typewritten letters to expose a fraud;[126] using gunpowder residue to expose two murderers;[127] and analyzing small pieces of human remains to expose two murders.[128]\n",
            "Because of the small scale of much of his evidence, the detective often uses a magnifying glass at the scene and an optical microscope at his Baker Street lodgings. He uses analytical chemistry for blood residue analysis and toxicology to detect poisons; Holmes's home chemistry laboratory is mentioned in \"The Naval Treaty\".[129] Ballistics feature in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" when spent bullets are recovered to be matched with a suspected murder weapon, a practice which became regular police procedure only some fifteen years after the story was published.[130]\n",
            "Laura J. Snyder has examined Holmes's methods in the context of mid- to late-19th-century criminology, demonstrating that, while sometimes in advance of what official investigative departments were formally using at the time, they were based upon existing methods and techniques. For example, fingerprints were proposed to be distinct in Conan Doyle's day, and while Holmes used a thumbprint to solve a crime in \"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\" (generally held to be set in 1895), the story was published in 1903, two years after Scotland Yard's fingerprint bureau opened.[122][131] Though the effect of the Holmes stories on the development of forensic science has thus often been overstated, Holmes inspired future generations of forensic scientists to think scientifically and analytically.[132]\n",

In several stories (\"The Sign of Four\", \"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\", \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\", \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" and \"A Scandal in Bohemia\"), to gather evidence undercover he uses disguises so convincing that Watson fails to recognise him. In others (\"The Adventure of the Dying Detective\" and \"A Scandal in Bohemia\"), Holmes feigns injury or illness to incriminate the guilty. In the latter story, Watson says, \"The stage lost a fine actor ... when [Holmes] became a specialist in crime\".[133]\n",

You might have aimed high if you had joined the fancy.\"[146] In \"The Yellow Face\", Watson says: \"He was undoubtedly one of the finest boxers of his weight that I have ever seen\".[147] In \"The Solitary Cyclist\" Holmes visits a country pub to make enquiries regarding a certain Mr Woodley which resulted in violence.

            "The first two Sherlock Holmes stories, the novels A Study in Scarlet (1887) and The Sign of the Four (1890), were moderately well received, but Holmes first became very popular early in 1891 when the first six short stories featuring the character were published in The Strand Magazine. Holmes became widely known in Britain and America.[1] The character was so well known that in 1893 when Arthur Conan Doyle killed Holmes in the short story \"The Final Problem\", the strongly negative response from readers was unlike any previous public reaction to a fictional event. The Strand reportedly lost more than 20,000 subscribers as a result of Holmes's death. Public pressure eventually contributed to Conan Doyle writing another Holmes story in 1901 and resurrecting the character in a story published in 1903.[7] In Japan, Sherlock Holmes (and Alice from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) became immensely popular in the country in the 1890s as it was opening up to the West, and they are cited as two British fictional Victorians who left an enormous creative and cultural legacy there.[152]\n",

Though the address 221B Baker Street did not exist when the stories were first published, letters began arriving to the large Abbey National building which first encompassed that address almost as soon as it was built in 1932. Fans continue to send letters to Sherlock Holmes;[153] these letters are now delivered to the Sherlock Holmes Museum.[154] Some of the people who have sent letters to 221B Baker Street believe Holmes is real.[4] Members of the general public have also believed Holmes actually existed. In a 2008 survey of British teenagers, 58 per cent of respondents believed that Sherlock Holmes was a real individual.[5]\n",

            "Although Holmes is not the original fictional detective, his name has become synonymous with the role. Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories introduced multiple literary devices that have become major conventions in detective fiction, such as the companion character who is not as clever as the detective and has solutions explained to him (thus informing the reader as well), as with Dr. Watson in the Holmes stories. Other conventions introduced by Doyle include the arch-criminal who is too clever for the official police to defeat, like Holmes's adversary Professor Moriarty, and the use of forensic science to solve cases.[1]\n",
            "The Sherlock Holmes stories established crime fiction as a respectable genre popular with readers of all backgrounds, and Doyle's success inspired many contemporary detective stories.[174] Holmes influenced the creation of other \"eccentric gentleman detective\" characters, like Agatha Christie's fictional detective Hercule Poirot, introduced in 1920.[175] Holmes also inspired a number of anti-hero characters \"almost as an antidote to the masterful detective\", such as the gentleman thief characters A. J. Raffles (created by E. W. Hornung in 1898) and Arsène Lupin (created by Maurice Leblanc in 1905).[174]\n",

            "\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"\n",
            "The phrase \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" has become one of the most quoted and iconic aspects of the character. However, although Holmes often observes that his conclusions are \"elementary\", and occasionally calls Watson \"my dear Watson\", the phrase \"Elementary, my dear Watson\" is never uttered in any of the sixty stories by Conan Doyle.[176] One of the nearest approximations of the phrase appears in \"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\" (1893) when Holmes explains a deduction: \"'Excellent!' I cried. 'Elementary,' said he.\"[177][178]\n",
            "William Gillette is widely considered to have originated the phrase with the formulation, \"Oh, this is elementary, my dear fellow\", allegedly in his 1899 play Sherlock Holmes. However, the script was revised numerous times over the course of some three decades of revivals and publications, and the phrase is present in some versions of the script, but not others.[176] The appearance of the line \"Elementary, my dear Potson\" in a Sherlock Holmes parody from 1901 has led some authors to speculate that, rather than this being an incidental formulation, the parodist drew upon an already well-established occurrences of \"Elementary, my dear Watson.\"[179][180]\n",
            "The exact phrase, as well as close variants, can be seen in newspaper and journal articles as early as 1909.[176][181] It was also used by P. G. Wodehouse in his novel Psmith, Journalist, which was first serialised in The Captain magazine between October 1909 and February 1910; the phrase occurred in the January 1910 instalment. The phrase became familiar with the American public in part due to its use in the Rathbone-Bruce series of films from 1939 to 1946.[182]\n",

            "Russ Stutler's view of 221B Baker StreetSherlock Holmes Museum, LondonStudyDrawing roomConan Doyle's 56 short stories and four novels are known as the \"canon\" by Holmes aficionados. The Great Game (also known as the Holmesian Game, the Sherlockian Game, or simply the Game, also the Higher Criticism) applies the methods of literary and especially Biblical criticism to the canon, operating on the pretense that Holmes and Watson were real people and that Conan Doyle was not the author of the stories but Watson's literary agent. From this basis, it attempts to resolve or explain away contradictions in the canon—such as the location of Watson's war wound, described as being in his shoulder in A Study in Scarlet and in his leg in The Sign of Four—and clarify details about Holmes, Watson and their world, such as the exact dates of events in the stories, combining historical research with references from the stories to construct scholarly analyses.[183][184][185]\n",
            "For example, one detail analyzed in the Game is Holmes's birth date. The chronology of the stories is notoriously difficult, with many stories lacking dates and many others containing contradictory ones. Christopher Morley and William Baring-Gould contend that the detective was born on 6 January 1854, the year being derived from the statement in \"His Last Bow\" that he was 60 years of age in 1914, while the precise day is derived from broader, non-canonical speculation.[186] This is the date the Baker Street Irregulars work from, with their annual dinner being held each January.[187][188] Laurie R. King instead argues that details in \"The Gloria Scott\" (a story with no precise internal date) indicate that Holmes finished his second (and final) year of university in 1880 or 1885. If he began university at age 17, his birth year could be as late as 1868.[189]\n",

For example, in one story Doyle makes mention of the Sumatran cannibals (also known as Batak) who throw poisonous darts, in \"The Adventure of the Devil's Foot\" a character employs a deadly West African poison, and in \"The Speckled Band\" a \"long residence in the tropics\" was a negative influence on one antagonist's bad temper.[197] Yumna Siddiqi argues that Doyle depicted returned colonials as \"marginal, physically ravaged characters that threaten the peace,\" while putting non-colonials in a much more positive light.[198]\n",

            "Adaptations and derived works\n",
            "The popularity of Sherlock Holmes has meant that many writers other than Arthur Conan Doyle have created tales of the detective in a wide variety of different media, with varying degrees of fidelity to the original characters, stories, and setting. The first known period pastiche dates from 1891. Titled \"The Late Sherlock Holmes\", it was written by Conan Doyle's close friend, J. M. Barrie.[199]\n",
            "Adaptations have seen the character taken in radically different directions or placed in different times or even universes. For example, Holmes falls in love and marries in Laurie R. King's Mary Russell series, is re-animated after his death to fight future crime in the animated series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century, and is meshed with the setting of H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos in Neil Gaiman's \"A Study in Emerald\" (which won the 2004 Hugo Award for Best Short Story). An especially influential pastiche was Nicholas Meyer's The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, a 1974 New York Times bestselling novel (made into the 1976 film of the same name) in which Holmes's cocaine addiction has progressed to the point of endangering his career. It served to popularize the trend of incorporating clearly identified and contemporaneous historical figures (such as Oscar Wilde, Aleister Crowley, Sigmund Freud, or Jack the Ripper) into Holmesian pastiches, something Conan Doyle himself never did.[200][201][202] Another common pastiche approach is to create a new story fully detailing an otherwise-passing canonical reference (such as an aside by Conan Doyle mentioning the \"giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared\" in \"The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\").[203]\n",

The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case, letting the appeals court's ruling stand. This resulted in the characters from the Holmes stories being in the public domain in the U.S. The stories still under copyright due to the ruling, as of that time, were those collected in The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes other than \"The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\" and \"The Problem of Thor Bridge\": a total of ten stories.[257][259][260]\n",
            "In 2020, although the United States court ruling and the passage of time meant that most of the Holmes stories and characters were in the public domain in that country, the Doyle estate legally challenged the use of Sherlock Holmes in the film Enola Holmes in a complaint filed in the United States.[261] The Doyle estate alleged that the film depicts Holmes with personality traits that were only exhibited by the character in the stories still under copyright.[262][263] On 18 December 2020, the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by stipulation of all parties.[264][265]\n",

Alexander, USMC (Ret)_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSunday, 4 March 1945, marked the end of the second week of the U.S.\\r\\ninvasion of Iwo Jima. By this point the assault elements of the 3d,\\r\\n4th, and 5th Marine Divisions were exhausted, their combat efficiency\\r\\nreduced to dangerously low levels. The thrilling sight of the American\\r\\nflag being raised by the 28th Marines on Mount Suribachi had occurred\\r\\n10 days earlier, a lifetime on “Sulphur Island.” The landing forces of\\r\\nthe V Amphibious Corps (VAC) had already sustained 13,000 casualties,\\r\\nincluding 3,000 dead. The “front lines” were a jagged serration across\\r\\nIwo’s fat northern half, still in the middle of the main Japanese\\r\\ndefenses. Ahead the going seemed all uphill against a well-disciplined,\\r\\nrarely visible enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the center of the island, the 3d Marine Division units had been\\r\\nup most of the night repelling a small but determined Japanese\\r\\ncounterattack which had found the seam between the 21st and 9th\\r\\nMarines. Vicious close combat had cost both sides heavy casualties.\\r\\nThe counterattack spoiled the division’s preparations for a morning\\r\\nadvance. Both regiments made marginal gains against very stiff\\r\\nopposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the east the 4th Marine Division had finally captured Hill 382,\\r\\nending its long exposure in “The Amphitheater,” but combat efficiency\\r\\nhad fallen to 50 percent. It would drop another five points by\\r\\nnightfall. On this day the 24th Marines, supported by flame tanks,\\r\\nadvanced a total of 100 yards, pausing to detonate more than a ton of\\r\\nexplosives against enemy cave positions in that sector. The 23d and\\r\\n25th Marines entered the most difficult terrain yet encountered, broken\\r\\nground that limited visibility to only a few feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the western flank, the 5th Marine Division had just seized\\r\\nNishi Ridge and Hill 362-B the previous day, suffering more than 500\\r\\ncasualties. It too had been up most of the night engaging a sizeable\\r\\nforce of infiltrators. The Sunday morning attacks lacked coordination,\\r\\nreflecting the division’s collective exhaustion. Most rifle companies\\r\\nwere at half-strength. The net gain for the day, the division reported,\\r\\nwas “practically nil.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: THE PACIFIC OFFENSIVE]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the battle was beginning to take its toll on the Japanese garrison\\r\\nas well. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi knew his _109th Division_ had\\r\\ninflicted heavy casualties on the attacking Marines, yet his own losses\\r\\nhad been comparable. The American capture of the key hills in the main\\r\\ndefense sector the day before deprived him of his invaluable artillery\\r\\nobservation sites. His brilliant chief of artillery, Colonel Chosaku\\r\\nKaido, lay dying. On this date Kuribayashi moved his own command post\\r\\nfrom the central highlands to a large cave on the northwest coast. The\\r\\nusual blandishments from Imperial General Headquarters in Tokyo reached\\r\\nhim by radio that afternoon, but Kuribayashi was in no mood for heroic\\r\\nrhetoric. “Send me air and naval support and I will hold the island,”\\r\\nhe signalled. “Without them I cannot hold.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Marine Corps Art Collection\\r\\n\\r\\n_“Silence in the Gorge,” an acrylic painting on masonite by Col Charles\\r\\nH. Waterhouse, USMCR (Ret), who as private first class was wounded\\r\\nduring the battle._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThat afternoon the fighting men of both sides witnessed a harbinger of\\r\\nIwo Jima’s fate. Through the overcast skies appeared a gigantic silver\\r\\nbomber, the largest aircraft anyone had ever seen. It was the Boeing\\r\\nB-29 Super Fortress “Dinah Might,” crippled in a raid over Tokyo,\\r\\nseeking an emergency landing on the island’s scruffy main airstrip.\\r\\nAs the Americans in the vicinity held their breaths, the big bomber\\r\\nswooped in from the south, landed heavily, clipped a field telephone\\r\\npole with a wing, and shuddered to a stop less than 50 feet from the\\r\\nbitter end of the strip. Pilot Lieutenant Fred Malo and his 10-man\\r\\ncrew were extremely glad to be alive, but they didn’t stay long. Every\\r\\nJapanese gunner within range wanted to bag this prize. Mechanics made\\r\\nfield repairs within a half hour. Then the 65-ton Superfort lumbered\\r\\naloft through a hail of enemy fire and headed back to its base in\\r\\nTinian. The Marines cheered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battle of Iwo Jima would rage on for another 22 days, claiming\\r\\neleven thousand more American casualties and the lives of virtually\\r\\nthe entire Japanese garrison. This was a colossal fight between two\\r\\nwell-armed, veteran forces--the biggest and bloodiest battle in the\\r\\nhistory of the United States Marine Corps. From the 4th of March on,\\r\\nhowever, the leaders of both sides entertained no doubts as to the\\r\\nultimate outcome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Assault Preparations_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIwo Jima was one of those rare amphibious landings where the assault\\r\\ntroops could clearly see the value of the objective. They were the\\r\\nfirst ground units to approach within a thousand miles of the Japanese\\r\\nhomeland, and they were participating directly in the support of the\\r\\nstrategic bombing campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter element represented a new wrinkle on an old theme. For\\r\\n40 years the U.S. Marines had been developing the capability for\\r\\nseizing advanced naval bases in support of the fleet. Increasingly in\\r\\nthe Pacific War--and most especially at Saipan, Tinian, and now Iwo\\r\\nJima--they were seizing advanced airbases to further the strategic\\r\\nbombing of the Japanese home islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican servicemen had awaited the coming of the B-29s for years. The\\r\\n“very-long-range” bombers, which had become operational too late for\\r\\nthe European War, had been striking mainland Japan since November 1944.\\r\\nResults proved disappointing. The problem stemmed not from the pilots\\r\\nor planes but rather from a vexing little spit of volcanic rock lying\\r\\nhalfway along the direct path from Saipan to Tokyo--Iwo Jima. Iwo’s\\r\\nradar gave the Japanese defense authorities two hours advance notice of\\r\\nevery B-29 strike. Japanese fighters based on Iwo swarmed up to harass\\r\\nthe unescorted Superforts going in and especially coming home, picking\\r\\noff those bombers crippled by antiaircraft (AA) fire. As a result,\\r\\nthe B-29s had to fly higher, along circuitous routes, with a reduced\\r\\npayload. At the same time, enemy bombers based on Iwo often raided B-29\\r\\nbases in the Marianas, causing some damage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff decided Iwo Jima must be captured and a U.S.\\r\\nairbase built there. This would eliminate Japanese bombing raids and\\r\\nthe early warning interceptions, provide fighter escorts throughout\\r\\nthe most dangerous portion of the long B-29 missions, and enable\\r\\ngreater payloads at longer ranges. Iwo Jima in American hands would\\r\\nalso provide a welcome emergency field for crippled B-29s returning\\r\\nfrom Tokyo. It would also protect the flank of the pending invasion\\r\\nof Okinawa. In October 1944 the Joint Chiefs directed Fleet Admiral\\r\\nChester W. Nimitz, CinCPac, to seize and develop Iwo Jima within the\\r\\nensuing three months. This launched Operation Detachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first enemy in the campaign would prove to be the island itself, an\\r\\nugly, barren, foul-smelling chunk of volcanic sand and rock, barely 10\\r\\nsquare miles in size. Iwo Jima means “Sulphur Island” in Japanese. As\\r\\ndescribed by one Imperial Army staff officer, the place was “an island\\r\\nof sulphur, no water, no sparrow, no swallow.” Less poetic American\\r\\nofficers saw Iwo’s resemblance to a pork chop, with the 556-foot\\r\\ndormant volcano Mount Suribachi dominating the narrow southern end,\\r\\noverlooking the only potential landing beaches. To the north, the land\\r\\nrose unevenly onto the Motoyama Plateau, falling off sharply along\\r\\nthe coasts into steep cliffs and canyons. The terrain in the north\\r\\nrepresented a defender’s dream: broken, convoluted, cave-dotted, a\\r\\n“jungle of stone.” Wreathed by volcanic steam, the twisted landscape\\r\\nappeared ungodly, almost moon-like. More than one surviving Marine\\r\\ncompared the island to something out of Dante’s _Inferno_.\\r\\n\\r\\nForbidding Iwo Jima had two redeeming features in 1945: the military\\r\\nvalue of its airfields and the psychological status of the island\\r\\nas a historical possession of Japan. Iwo Jima lay in Japan’s “Inner\\r\\nVital Defense Zone” and was in fact administered as part of the Tokyo\\r\\nPrefecture. In the words of one Japanese officer, “Iwo Jima is the\\r\\ndoorkeeper to the Imperial capital.” Even by the slowest aircraft,\\r\\nTokyo could be reached in three flight hours from Iwo. In the battle\\r\\nfor Iwo Jima, a total of 28,000 Americans and Japanese would give their\\r\\nlives in savage fighting during the last winter months of 1945.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one on the American side ever suggested that taking Iwo Jima would\\r\\nbe an easy proposition. Admiral Nimitz assigned this mission to the\\r\\nsame team which had prevailed so effectively in the earlier amphibious\\r\\nassaults in the Gilberts, Marshalls, and Marianas: Admiral Raymond\\r\\nA. Spruance, commanding the Fifth Fleet; Vice Admiral Richmond Kelly\\r\\nTurner, commanding the Expeditionary Forces; and Rear Admiral Harry W.\\r\\nHill, commanding the Attack Force. Spruance added the highly regarded\\r\\nRear Admiral William H.\\xa0P. Blandy, a veteran of the Peleliu/Angaur\\r\\nlandings, to command the Amphibious Support Forces, responsible for\\r\\nminesweeping, underwater demolition team operations, and preliminary\\r\\nnaval air and gun bombardment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs usual, “maintaining unremitting military pressure on the enemy”\\r\\nmeant an accelerated planning schedule and an overriding emphasis on\\r\\nspeed of execution. The amphibious task force preparing to assault\\r\\nIwo Jima soon found itself squeezed on both ends. Hill and Blandy had\\r\\na critical need for the amphibious ships, landing craft, and shore\\r\\nbombardment vessels currently being used by General Douglas MacArthur\\r\\nin his reconquest of Luzon in the Philippines. But bad weather and\\r\\nstiff enemy resistance combined to delay completion of that operation.\\r\\nThe Joint Chiefs reluctantly postponed D-day for Iwo Jima from 20\\r\\nJanuary 1945 until 19 February. The tail end of the schedule provided\\r\\nno relief. D-Day for Okinawa could go no later than 1 April because of\\r\\nthe approach of the monsoon season. The constricted time frame for Iwo\\r\\nwould have grave implications for the landing force.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe experienced V Amphibious Corps under Major General Harry Schmidt,\\r\\nUSMC, would provide the landing force, an unprecedented assembly of\\r\\nthree Marine divisions, the 3d, 4th, and 5th. Schmidt would have the\\r\\ndistinction of commanding the largest force of U.S. Marines ever\\r\\ncommitted in a single battle, a combined force which eventually\\r\\ntotalled more than 80,000 men. Well above half of these Marines were\\r\\nveterans of earlier fighting in the Pacific; realistic training had\\r\\nprepared the newcomers well. The troops assaulting Iwo Jima were\\r\\narguably the most proficient amphibious forces the world had seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, two senior Marines shared the limelight for the Iwo\\r\\nJima battle, and history has often done both an injustice. Spruance\\r\\nand Turner prevailed upon Lieutenant General Holland M. Smith, then\\r\\ncommanding Fleet Marine Forces, Pacific, to participate in Operation\\r\\nDetachment as Commanding General, Expeditionary Troops. This was\\r\\na gratuitous billet. Schmidt had the rank, experience, staff, and\\r\\nresources to execute corps-level responsibility without being\\r\\nsecond-guessed by another headquarters. Smith, the amphibious pioneer\\r\\nand veteran of landings in the Aleutians, Gilberts, Marshalls, and\\r\\nMarianas, admitted to being embarrassed by the assignment. “My sun had\\r\\nalmost set by then,” he stated, “I think they asked me along only in\\r\\ncase something happened to Harry Schmidt.” Smith tried to keep out\\r\\nof Schmidt’s way, but his subsequent decision to withhold commitment\\r\\nof the 3d Marines, the Expeditionary Troops reserve, remains as\\r\\ncontroversial today as it was in 1945.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 109649\\r\\n\\r\\n_Burdened with heavy packs and equipment, Marine communicators dash for\\r\\ncover while advancing under heavy fire during the drive inland from the\\r\\nbeaches._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHolland Smith was an undeniable asset to the Iwo Jima campaign. During\\r\\nthe top-level planning stage he was often, as always, a “voice in the\\r\\nwilderness,” predicting severe casualties unless greater and more\\r\\neffective preliminary naval bombardment was provided. He diverted the\\r\\npress and the visiting dignitaries from Schmidt, always providing\\r\\nrealistic counterpoints to some of the rosier staff estimates. “It’s a\\r\\ntough proposition,” Smith would say about Iwo, “That’s why we are here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Schmidt, whose few public pronouncements left him saddled with\\r\\nthe unfortunate prediction of a 10-day conquest of Iwo Jima, came to\\r\\nresent the perceived role Holland Smith played in post-war accounts. As\\r\\nhe would forcibly state:\\r\\n\\r\\n  I was the commander of all troops on Iwo Jima at all times. Holland\\r\\n  Smith never had a command post ashore, never issued a single order\\r\\n  ashore, never spent a single night ashore.... Isn’t it important\\r\\n  from an historical standpoint that I commanded the greatest number\\r\\n  of Marines ever to be engaged in a single action in the entire\\r\\n  history of the Marine Corps?\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Smith would not disagree with those points. Smith provided a\\r\\nuseful role, but Schmidt and his exceptional staff deserve maximum\\r\\ncredit for planning and executing the difficult and bloody battle of\\r\\nIwo Jima.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe V Amphibious Corps achievement was made even more memorable by\\r\\nthe enormously difficult opposition provided by the island and the\\r\\nenemy. In Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi [see sidebar], the\\r\\nAmericans faced one of the most formidable opponents of the war. A\\r\\nfifth-generation _samurai_, hand-picked and personally extolled by the\\r\\nEmperor, Kuribayashi combined combat experience with an innovative\\r\\nmind and an iron will. Although this would be his only combat against\\r\\nAmerican forces, he had learned much about his prospective opponents\\r\\nfrom earlier service in the United States. More significantly,\\r\\nhe could appraise with an unblinking eye the results of previous\\r\\nJapanese attempts to repel American invasions of Japanese-held\\r\\ngarrisons. Heroic rhetoric aside, Kuribayashi saw little to commend\\r\\nthe “defend-at-the-water’s-edge” tactics and “all-or-nothing” _Banzai_\\r\\nattacks which had characterized Japan’s failures from Tarawa to Tinian.\\r\\nKuribayashi, a realist, also knew not to expect much help from Japan’s\\r\\ndepleted fleet and air forces. His best chances, he concluded, would\\r\\nbe to maximize Iwo’s forbidding terrain with a defense in depth, along\\r\\nthe pattern of the recent Biak and Peleliu defensive efforts. He would\\r\\neschew coast defense, anti-landing, and _Banzai_ tactics and instead\\r\\nconduct a prolonged battle of attrition, a war of nerves, patience, and\\r\\ntime. Possibly the Americans would lose heart and abandon the campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a seemingly passive policy, even that late in the war, seemed\\r\\nrevolutionary to senior Japanese Army and Navy leaders. It ran counter\\r\\nto the deeply ingrained warrior code, which viewed the defensive as\\r\\nonly an unpleasant interim pending resumption of the glorious offensive\\r\\nin which one could destroy the enemy with sword and bayonet. Even\\r\\nImperial General Headquarters grew nervous. There is some evidence\\r\\nof a top-level request for guidance in defending against American\\r\\n“storm landings” from Nazi Germany, whose sad experience in trying\\r\\nto defend Normandy at the water’s edge had proven disastrous. The\\r\\nJapanese remained unconvinced. Kuribayashi needed every bit of his top\\r\\nconnections with the Emperor to keep from being summarily relieved\\r\\nfor his radical proposals. His was not a complete organizational\\r\\nvictory--the Navy insisted on building gun casemates and blockhouses\\r\\nalong the obvious landing beaches on Iwo--but in general he prevailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nKuribayashi demanded the assistance of the finest mining engineers\\r\\nand fortifications specialists in the Empire. Here again, the island\\r\\nfavored the defender. Iwo’s volcanic sand mixed readily with cement to\\r\\nproduce superior concrete for installations; the soft rock lent itself\\r\\nto rapid digging. Half the garrison lay aside their weapons to labor\\r\\nwith pick and spade. When American heavy bombers from the Seventh Air\\r\\nForce commenced a daily pounding of the island in early December 1944,\\r\\nKuribayashi simply moved everything--weapons, command posts, barracks,\\r\\naid stations--underground. These engineering achievements were\\r\\nremarkable. Masked gun positions provided interlocking fields of fire,\\r\\nmiles of tunnels linked key defensive positions, every cave featured\\r\\nmultiple outlets and ventilation tubes. One installation inside Mount\\r\\nSuribachi ran seven stories deep. The Americans would rarely see a live\\r\\nJapanese on Iwo Jima until the bitter end.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican intelligence experts, aided by documents captured in\\r\\nSaipan and by an almost daily flow of aerial photography (and\\r\\nperiscope-level pictures from the submarine _Spearfish_), puzzled\\r\\nover the “disappearing act” of the Japanese garrison. Trained photo\\r\\ninterpreters, using stereoscopic lenses, listed nearly 700 potential\\r\\ntargets, but all were hardened, covered, masked. The intelligence\\r\\nstaffs knew there was no fresh water available on the island. They\\r\\ncould see the rainwater cisterns and they knew what the average monthly\\r\\nrainfall would deliver. They concluded the garrison could not possibly\\r\\nsurvive under those conditions in numbers greater than 12,000 or\\r\\n13,000. But Kuribayashi’s force was twice that size. The men existed on\\r\\nhalf-rations of water for months before the battle began.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike earlier amphibious assaults at Guadalcanal and Tarawa, the\\r\\nAmericans would not enjoy either strategic or tactical surprise at\\r\\nIwo Jima. Japanese strategists concluded Iwo Jima would be invaded\\r\\nsoon after the loss of the Marianas. Six months before the battle,\\r\\nKuribayashi wrote his wife, “The Americans will surely invade this\\r\\nIwo Jima ... do not look for my return.” He worked his men ruthlessly\\r\\nto complete all defensive and training preparations by 11 February\\r\\n1945--and met the objective. His was a mixed force of veterans and\\r\\nrecruits, soldiers and sailors. His artillerymen and mortar crews were\\r\\namong the best in the Empire. Regardless, he trained and disciplined\\r\\nthem all. As the Americans soon discovered, each fighting position\\r\\ncontained the commander’s “Courageous Battle Vows” prominently posted\\r\\nabove the firing apertures. Troops were admonished to maintain their\\r\\npositions and exact 10 American lives for every Japanese death.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Schmidt issued VAC Operation Plan 5-44 on 23 December 1944. The\\r\\nplan offered nothing fancy. Mount Suribachi dominated both potential\\r\\nbeaches, but the 3,000 yards of black sand along the southeastern\\r\\ncoast appeared more sheltered from the prevailing winds. Here the V\\r\\nAmphibious Corps would land on D-day, the 4th Marine Division on the\\r\\nright, the 5th on the left, the 3d in reserve. The initial objectives\\r\\nincluded the lower airfield, the west coast, and Suribachi. Then the\\r\\nforce would swing into line and attack north, shoulder to shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnticipation of a major Japanese counterattack the first night\\r\\ninfluenced the landing plan. “We welcome a counterattack,” said Holland\\r\\nSmith, “That’s generally when we break their backs.” Both Schmidt and\\r\\n4th Marine Division commander Major General Clifton B. Cates knew from\\r\\nrecent experience at Tinian how capable the Japanese were at assembling\\r\\nlarge reserves at potential soft points along a fresh beachhead. The\\r\\nassault divisions would plan to land their artillery regiments before\\r\\ndark on D-day in that contingency.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    E.L. Wilson\\r\\n\\r\\nIWO JIMA\\r\\n\\r\\n(SULPHUR ISLAND)]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe physical separation of the three divisions, from Guam to Hawaii,\\r\\nhad no adverse effect on preparatory training. Where it counted\\r\\nmost--the proficiency of small units in amphibious landings and\\r\\ncombined-arms assaults on fortified positions--each division was\\r\\nwell prepared for the forthcoming invasion. The 3d Marine Division\\r\\nhad just completed its participation in the successful recapture of\\r\\nGuam; field training often extended to active combat patrols to root\\r\\nout die-hard Japanese survivors. In Maui, the 4th Marine Division\\r\\nprepared for its fourth major assault landing in 13 months with quiet\\r\\nconfidence. Recalled Major Frederick J. Karch, operations officer\\r\\nfor the 14th Marines, “we had a continuity there of veterans that\\r\\nwas just unbeatable.” In neighboring Hawaii, the 5th Marine Division\\r\\ncalmly prepared for its first combat experience. The unit’s newness\\r\\nwould prove misleading. Well above half of the officers and men were\\r\\nveterans, including a number of former Marine parachutists and a few\\r\\nRaiders who had first fought in the Solomons. Lieutenant Colonel Donn\\r\\nJ. Robertson took command of the 3d Battalion, 27th Marines, barely\\r\\ntwo weeks before embarkation and immediately ordered it into the field\\r\\nfor a sustained live-firing exercise. Its competence and confidence\\r\\nimpressed him. “These were professionals,” he concluded.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 112392\\r\\n\\r\\n_“Dinah Might,” the first crippled B-29 to make an emergency landing on\\r\\nIwo Jima during the fighting, is surrounded by Marines and Seabees on 4\\r\\nMarch 1945._]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the veterans preparing for Iwo Jima were two Medal of Honor\\r\\nrecipients from the Guadalcanal campaign, Gunnery Sergeant John “Manila\\r\\nJohn” Basilone and Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Galer. Headquarters\\r\\nMarine Corps preferred to keep such distinguished veterans in the\\r\\nstates for morale purposes, but both men wrangled their way back\\r\\noverseas--Basilone leading a machine gun platoon, Galer delivering\\r\\na new radar unit for employment with the Landing Force Air Support\\r\\nControl Unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Guadalcanal veterans would only shake their heads at the abundance\\r\\nof amphibious shipping available for Operation Detachment. Admiral\\r\\nTurner would command 495 ships, of which fully 140 were amphibiously\\r\\nconfigured, the whole array 10 times the size of Guadalcanal’s task\\r\\nforce. Still there were problems. So many of the ships and crews were\\r\\nnew that each rehearsal featured embarrassing collisions and other\\r\\naccidents. The new TD-18 bulldozers were found to be an inch too\\r\\nwide for the medium landing craft (LCMs). The newly modified M4A3\\r\\nSherman tanks proved so heavy that the LCMs rode with dangerously low\\r\\nfreeboards. Likewise, 105mm howitzers overloaded the amphibious trucks\\r\\n(DUKWs) to the point of near-unseaworthiness. These factors would prove\\r\\ncostly in Iwo’s unpredictable surf zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese problems notwithstanding, the huge force embarked and began the\\r\\nfamiliar move to westward. Said Colonel Robert E. Hogaboom, Chief of\\r\\nStaff, 3d Marine Division, “we were in good shape, well trained, well\\r\\nequipped and thoroughly supported.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Iwo Jima, General Kuribayashi had benefitted from the American\\r\\npostponements of Operation Detachment because of delays in the\\r\\nPhilippines campaign. He, too, felt as ready and prepared as possible.\\r\\nWhen the American armada sailed from the Marianas on 13 February, he\\r\\nwas forewarned. He deployed one infantry battalion in the vicinity of\\r\\nthe beaches and lower airfield, ordered the bulk of his garrison into\\r\\nits assigned fighting holes, and settled down to await the inevitable\\r\\nstorm.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _An aerial view of Iwo Jima before the landing clearly\\r\\nshows “pork chop” shape. Mount Suribachi, in the right foreground, is\\r\\nat the southern end of the island._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 413529\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo contentious issues divided the Navy-Marine team as D-day at Iwo\\r\\nJima loomed closer. The first involved Admiral Spruance’s decision to\\r\\ndetach Task Force 58, the fast carriers under Admiral Marc Mitscher,\\r\\nto attack strategic targets on Honshu simultaneously with the onset of\\r\\nAdmiral Blandy’s preliminary bombardment of Iwo. The Marines suspected\\r\\nNavy-Air Force rivalry at work here--most of Mitscher’s targets were\\r\\naircraft factories which the B-29s had missed badly a few days earlier.\\r\\nWhat the Marines really begrudged was Mitscher taking all eight Marine\\r\\nCorps fighter squadrons, assigned to the fast carriers, plus the new\\r\\nfast battleships with their 16-inch guns. Task Force 58 returned to Iwo\\r\\nin time to render sparkling support with these assets on D-day, but two\\r\\ndays later it was off again, this time for good.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Col William P. McCahill Collection\\r\\n\\r\\n_A Marine inspects a Japanese coastal defense gun which, although\\r\\nprotected by steel-reinforced concrete, was destroyed in prelanding\\r\\nnaval gunfire bombardments._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other issue was related and it concerned the continuing argument\\r\\nbetween senior Navy and Marine officers over the extent of preliminary\\r\\nnaval gunfire. The Marines looked at the intelligence reports on Iwo\\r\\nand requested 10 days of preliminary fire. The Navy said it had neither\\r\\nthe time nor the ammo to spare; three days would have to suffice.\\r\\nHolland Smith and Harry Schmidt continued to plead, finally offering\\r\\nto compromise to four days. Turner deferred to Spruance who ruled that\\r\\nthree days prep fires, in conjunction with the daily pounding being\\r\\nadministered by the Seventh Air Force, would do the job.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Colonel Donald M. Weller, USMC, served as the FMFPAC/Task\\r\\nForce 51 naval gunfire officer, and no one in either sea service knew\\r\\nthe business more thoroughly. Weller had absorbed the lessons of the\\r\\nPacific War well, especially those of the conspicuous failures at\\r\\nTarawa. The issue, he argued forcibly to Admiral Turner, was not the\\r\\nweight of shells nor their caliber but rather time. Destruction of\\r\\nheavily fortified enemy targets took deliberate, pinpoint firing from\\r\\nclose ranges, assessed and adjusted by aerial observers. Iwo Jima’s 700\\r\\n“hard” targets would require time to knock out, a lot of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Spruance nor Turner had time to give, for strategic, tactical,\\r\\nand logistical reasons. Three days of firing by Admiral Blandy’s\\r\\nsizeable bombardment force would deliver four times the amount of\\r\\nshells Tarawa received, and one and a half times that delivered against\\r\\nlarger Saipan. It would have to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: JAPANESE DEFENSE SECTORS]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn effect, Iwo’s notorious foul weather, the imperviousness of many of\\r\\nthe Japanese fortifications, and other distractions dissipated even the\\r\\nthree days’ bombardment. “We got about thirteen hours’ worth of fire\\r\\nsupport during the thirty-four hours of available daylight,” complained\\r\\nBrigadier General William W. Rogers, chief of staff to General Schmidt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Americans received an unexpected bonus when General Kuribayashi\\r\\ncommitted his only known tactical error during the battle. This\\r\\noccurred on D-minus-2, as a force of 100 Navy and Marine underwater\\r\\ndemolition team (UDT) frogmen bravely approached the eastern beaches\\r\\nescorted by a dozen LCI landing craft firing their guns and rockets.\\r\\nKuribayashi evidently believed this to be the main landing and\\r\\nauthorized the coastal batteries to open fire. The exchange was hot and\\r\\nheavy, with the LCIs getting the worst of it, but U.S. battleships and\\r\\ncruisers hurried in to blast the casemate guns suddenly revealed on the\\r\\nslopes of Suribachi and along the rock quarry on the right flank.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night, gravely concerned about the hundreds of Japanese targets\\r\\nstill untouched by two days of firing, Admiral Blandy conducted a\\r\\n“council of war” on board his flagship. At Weller’s suggestion, Blandy\\r\\njunked the original plan and directed his gunships to concentrate\\r\\nexclusively on the beach areas. This was done with considerable effect\\r\\non D-minus-1 and D-day morning itself. Kuribayashi noted that most of\\r\\nthe positions the Imperial Navy insisted on building along the beach\\r\\napproaches had in fact been destroyed, as he had predicted. Yet his\\r\\nmain defensive belts criss-crossing the Motoyama Plateau remained\\r\\nintact. “I pray for a heroic fight,” he told his staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn board Admiral Turner’s flagship, the press briefing held the night\\r\\nbefore D-day was uncommonly somber. General Holland Smith predicted\\r\\nheavy casualties, possibly as many as 15,000, which shocked all hands.\\r\\nA man clad in khakis without rank insignia then stood up to address the\\r\\nroom. It was James V. Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy. “Iwo Jima, like\\r\\nTarawa, leaves very little choice,” he said quietly, “except to take it\\r\\nby force of arms, by character and courage.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidebar (page 6): The Japanese Commander\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the estimation of Lieutenant Colonel Justice M.

The U.S.\\r\\nMarines have rarely faced a tougher opponent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 152108\\r\\n\\r\\n_LtGen Tadamichi Kuribayashi, Imperial Japanese Army._]\\r\\n\\r\\nKuribayashi, 53, a native of Nagano Prefecture, had served the Emperor\\r\\nas a cavalry officer since graduating from the Military Academy in\\r\\n1914. He spent several years as a junior officer posted to the Japanese\\r\\nEmbassies in America and Canada. With the advent of war in Asia,\\r\\nKuribayashi commanded a cavalry regiment in combat in Manchuria and\\r\\na brigade in northern China. Later, he served as chief of staff of\\r\\nthe _Twenty-third Army_ during the capture of Hong Kong. Favored by\\r\\nthe Emperor, he returned from China to command the _Imperial Guards\\r\\nDivision_ in Tokyo. After the fall of Saipan in June 1944, he was\\r\\nassigned to command the defensive fortress of Iwo Jima.\\r\\n\\r\\nKuribayashi was a realist. He saw Iwo Jima’s crude airstrips as a net\\r\\nliability to the Empire, at best providing nuisance raids against the\\r\\nB-29s, certain to draw the attention of American strategic planners.\\r\\nIwo Jima’s airfields in American hands would pose an enormous threat\\r\\nto Japan. Kuribayashi saw only two options: either blow up the entire\\r\\nisland, which proved infeasible, or defend it to the death. To do the\\r\\nlatter effectively he adapted a radical defensive policy, foregoing\\r\\nthe water’s-edge linear tactics and suicidal _Banzai_ attacks of\\r\\nprevious island battles. This stirred controversy at the highest\\r\\nlevels--Imperial Headquarters even asked the Nazis for advice on\\r\\nrepelling American invasions--as well as among Kuribayashi’s own\\r\\nofficers. Kuribayashi made some compromises with the semi-independent\\r\\nnaval forces on the island, but sacked 18 senior army officers,\\r\\nincluding his own chief of staff. Those who remained would implement\\r\\ntheir commander’s policy to the letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoomed without naval or air support, Kuribayashi nevertheless proved\\r\\nto be a resolute and resourceful field commander. His only tactical\\r\\nerror was to authorize the sector commander to engage the U.S. task\\r\\nforce covering underwater demolitions team operations on D-2. This\\r\\nbecame a gift to the attackers, for it revealed to American gunners the\\r\\npreviously masked batteries which otherwise would have slaughtered the\\r\\nassault waves on D-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese accounts indicate Kuribayashi committed _hara-kari_, the\\r\\nJapanese ritual suicide, in his cave near Kitano Point on 23 March\\r\\n1945, the 33d day of the battle. “Of all our adversaries in the\\r\\nPacific,” said General Holland M. Smith, USMC, “Kuribayashi was the\\r\\nmost redoubtable.” Said another Marine, “Let’s hope the Japs don’t have\\r\\nany more like him.”\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_D-Day_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWeather conditions around Iwo Jima on D-day morning, 19 February 1945,\\r\\nwere almost ideal. At 0645 Admiral Turner signalled “Land the landing\\r\\nforce!”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _From the Japanese position overlooking the landing\\r\\nbeaches and Airfield No. 1, the enemy observers had an unobstructed\\r\\nview of the entire beachhead.

Battleships and cruisers steamed as close\\r\\nas 2,000 yards to level their guns against island targets. Many of\\r\\nthe “Old Battleships” had performed this dangerous mission in all\\r\\ntheaters of the war. Marines came to recognize and appreciate their\\r\\ncontributions. It seemed fitting that the old _Nevada_, raised from the\\r\\nmuck and ruin of Pearl Harbor, should lead the bombardment force close\\r\\nashore. Marines also admired the battleship _Arkansas_, built in 1912,\\r\\nand recently returned from the Atlantic where she had battered German\\r\\npositions at Point du Hoc at Normandy during the epic Allied landing on\\r\\n6 June 1944.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 14284\\r\\n\\r\\n_Members of the 4th Marine Division receive a last-minute briefing\\r\\nbefore D-day._]\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Colonels Weller and William W. “Bucky” Buchanan, both\\r\\nartillery officers, had devised a modified form of the “rolling\\r\\nbarrage” for use by the bombarding gunships against beachfront targets\\r\\njust before H-Hour. This concentration of naval gunfire would advance\\r\\nprogressively as the troops landed, always remaining 400 yards to their\\r\\nfront. Air spotters would help regulate the pace. Such an innovation\\r\\nappealed to the three division commanders, each having served in France\\r\\nduring World War I. In those days, a good rolling barrage was often the\\r\\nonly way to break a stalemate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shelling was terrific. Admiral Hill would later boast that “there\\r\\nwere no proper targets for shore bombardment remaining on Dog-Day\\r\\nmorning.” This proved to be an overstatement, yet no one could deny the\\r\\nunprecedented intensity of firepower Hill delivered against the areas\\r\\nsurrounding the landing beaches. As General Kuribayashi would ruefully\\r\\nadmit in an assessment report to Imperial General Headquarters, “we\\r\\nneed to reconsider the power of bombardment from ships; the violence of\\r\\nthe enemy’s bombardments is far beyond description.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amphibious task force appeared from over the horizon, the rails\\r\\nof the troopships crowded with combat-equipped Marines watching the\\r\\nspectacular fireworks. The Guadalcanal veterans among them realized a\\r\\ngrim satisfaction watching American battleships leisurely pounding the\\r\\nisland from just offshore. The war had come full cycle from the dark\\r\\ndays of October 1942 when the 1st Marine Division and the Cactus Air\\r\\nForce endured similar shelling from Japanese battleships.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marines and sailors were anxious to get their first glimpse of the\\r\\nobjective. Correspondent John P. Marquand, the Pulitzer Prize-winning\\r\\nwriter, recorded his own first impressions of Iwo: “Its silhouette was\\r\\nlike a sea monster, with the little dead volcano for the head, and\\r\\nthe beach area for the neck, and all the rest of it, with its scrubby\\r\\nbrown cliffs for the body.” Lieutenant David N. Susskind, USNR, wrote\\r\\ndown his initial thoughts from the bridge of the troopship _Mellette_:\\r\\n“Iwo Jima was a rude, ugly sight.... Only a geologist could look at it\\r\\nand not be repelled.” As described in a subsequent letter home by Navy\\r\\nLieutenant Michael F. Keleher, a surgeon in the 25th Marines:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The naval bombardment had already begun and I could see the\\r\\n  orange-yellow flashes as the battleships, cruisers, and\\r\\n  destroyers blasted away at the island broadside. Yes, there was\\r\\n  Iwo--surprisingly close, just like the pictures and models we had\\r\\n  been studying for six weeks. The volcano was to our left, then the\\r\\n  long, flat black beaches where we were going to land, and the rough\\r\\n  rocky plateau to our right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commanders of the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions, Major Generals\\r\\nClifton B. Cates and Keller E. Rockey, respectively, studied the island\\r\\nthrough binoculars from their respective ships. Each division would\\r\\nland two reinforced regiments abreast. From left to right, the beaches\\r\\nwere designated Green, Red, Yellow, and Blue. The 5th Division would\\r\\nland the 28th Marines on the left flank, over Green Beach, the 27th\\r\\nMarines over Red. The 4th Division would land the 23d Marines over\\r\\nYellow Beach and the 25th Marines over Blue Beach on the right flank.\\r\\nGeneral Schmidt reviewed the latest intelligence reports with growing\\r\\nuneasiness and requested a reassignment of reserve forces with General\\r\\nSmith. The 3d Marine Division’s 21st Marines would replace the 26th\\r\\nMarines as corps reserve, thus releasing the latter regiment to the 5th\\r\\nDivision.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchmidt’s landing plan envisioned the 28th Marines cutting the island\\r\\nin half, then turning to capture Suribachi, while the 25th Marines\\r\\nwould scale the Rock Quarry and then serve as the hinge for the entire\\r\\ncorps to swing around to the north. The 23d Marines and 27th Marines\\r\\nwould capture the first airfield and pivot north within their assigned\\r\\nzones.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Cates was already concerned about the right flank. Blue Beach\\r\\nTwo lay directly under the observation and fire of suspected Japanese\\r\\npositions in the Rock Quarry, whose steep cliffs overshadowed the\\r\\nright flank like Suribachi dominated the left. The 4th Marine Division\\r\\nfigured that the 25th Marines would have the hardest objective to take\\r\\non D-day. Said Cates, “If I knew the name of the man on the extreme\\r\\nright of the right-hand squad I’d recommend him for a medal before we\\r\\ngo in.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe choreography of the landing continued to develop. Iwo Jima would\\r\\nrepresent the pinnacle of forcible amphibious assault against a heavily\\r\\nfortified shore, a complex art mastered painstakingly by the Fifth\\r\\nFleet over many campaigns. Seventh Air Force Martin B-24 Liberator\\r\\nbombers flew in from the Marianas to strike the smoking island.\\r\\nRocket ships moved in to saturate nearshore targets. Then it was time\\r\\nfor the fighter and attack squadrons from Mitscher’s Task Force 58\\r\\nto contribute. The Navy pilots showed their skills at bombing and\\r\\nstrafing, but the troops naturally cheered the most at the appearance\\r\\nof F4U Corsairs flown by Marine Fighter Squadrons 124 and 213 led\\r\\nby Lieutenant Colonel William A. Millington from the fleet carrier\\r\\n_Essex_. Colonel Vernon E. Megee, in his shipboard capacity as air\\r\\nofficer for General Smith’s Expeditionary Troops staff, had urged\\r\\nMillington to put on a special show for the troops in the assault\\r\\nwaves. “Drag your bellies on the beach,” he told Millington. The Marine\\r\\nfighters made an impressive approach parallel to the island, then\\r\\nvirtually did Megee’s bidding, streaking low over the beaches, strafing\\r\\nfuriously. The geography of the Pacific War since Bougainville had kept\\r\\nmany of the ground Marines separated from their own air support, which\\r\\nhad been operating in areas other than where they had been fighting,\\r\\nmost notably the Central Pacific. “It was the first time a lot of them\\r\\nhad ever seen a Marine fighter plane,” said Megee. The troops were not\\r\\ndisappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Laden with battle-ready V Amphibious Corps Marines,\\r\\nLSMs (landing ship, medium) head for Iwo’s beaches.

This time there were enough\\r\\nLVTs to do the job: 68 LVT(A)4 armored amtracs mounting snub-nosed\\r\\n75mm cannon leading the way, followed by 380 troop-laden LVT 4s and\\r\\nLVT 2s. The waves crossed the line of departure on time and chugged\\r\\nconfidently towards the smoking beaches, all the while under the\\r\\nclimactic bombardment from the ships. Here there was no coral reef, no\\r\\nkiller neap tides to be concerned with. The Navy and Marine frogmen had\\r\\nreported the approaches free of mines or tetrahedrons. There was no\\r\\npremature cessation of fire. The “rolling barrage” plan took effect.\\r\\nHardly a vehicle was lost to the desultory enemy fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe massive assault waves hit the beach within two minutes of H-hour.\\r\\nA Japanese observer watching the drama unfold from a cave on the\\r\\nslopes of Suribachi reported, “At nine o’clock in the morning several\\r\\nhundred landing craft with amphibious tanks in the lead rushed ashore\\r\\nlike an enormous tidal wave.” Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Williams,\\r\\nexecutive officer of the 28th Marines, recalled that “the landing was a\\r\\nmagnificent sight to see--two divisions landing abreast; you could see\\r\\nthe whole show from the deck of a ship.” To this point, so far, so good.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first obstacle came not from the Japanese but the beach and the\\r\\nparallel terraces. Iwo Jima was an emerging volcano; its steep beaches\\r\\ndropped off sharply, producing a narrow but violent surf zone. The\\r\\nsoft black sand immobilized all wheeled vehicles and caused some of the\\r\\ntracked amphibians to belly down. The boat waves that closely followed\\r\\nthe LVTs had more trouble. Ramps would drop, a truck or jeep would\\r\\nattempt to drive out, only to get stuck. In short order a succession\\r\\nof plunging waves hit the stalled craft before they could completely\\r\\nunload, filling their sterns with water and sand, broaching them\\r\\nbroadside. The beach quickly resembled a salvage yard.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: LANDING PLAN\\r\\n\\r\\nIWO JIMA\\r\\n\\r\\n    E.L. Wilson\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe infantry, heavily laden, found its own “foot-mobility” severely\\r\\nrestricted. In the words of Corporal Edward Hartman, a rifleman with\\r\\nthe 4th Marine Division: “the sand was so soft it was like trying to\\r\\nrun in loose coffee grounds.” From the 28th Marines came this early,\\r\\nlaconic report: “Resistance moderate, terrain awful.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rolling barrage and carefully executed landing produced the desired\\r\\neffect, suppressing direct enemy fire, providing enough shock and\\r\\ndistraction to enable the first assault waves to clear the beach and\\r\\nbegin advancing inward. Within minutes 6,000 Marines were ashore. Many\\r\\nbecame thwarted by increasing fire over the terraces or down from the\\r\\nhighlands, but hundreds leapt forward to maintain assault momentum.\\r\\nThe 28th Marines on the left flank had rehearsed on similar volcanic\\r\\nterrain on the island of Hawaii. Now, despite increasing casualties\\r\\namong their company commanders and the usual disorganization of\\r\\nlanding, elements of the regiment used their initiative to strike\\r\\nacross the narrow neck of the peninsula. The going became progressively\\r\\ncostly as more and more Japanese strongpoints along the base of\\r\\nSuribachi seemed to spring to life. Within 90 minutes of the landing,\\r\\nhowever, elements of the 1st Battalion, 28th Marines, had reached the\\r\\nwestern shore, 700 yards across from Green Beach. Iwo Jima had been\\r\\nsevered--“like cutting off a snake’s head,” in the words of one Marine.\\r\\nIt would represent the deepest penetration of what was becoming a very\\r\\nlong and costly day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other three regiments experienced difficulty leaving the black sand\\r\\nterraces and wheeling across towards the first airfield. The terrain\\r\\nwas an open bowl, a shooting gallery in full view from Suribachi on\\r\\nthe left and the rising tableland to the right. Any thoughts of a\\r\\n“cakewalk” quickly vanished as well-directed machine-gun fire whistled\\r\\nacross the open ground and mortar rounds began dropping along the\\r\\nterraces. Despite these difficulties, the 27th Marines made good\\r\\ninitial gains, reaching the southern and western edges of the first\\r\\nairfield before noon. The 23d Marines landed over Yellow Beach and\\r\\nsustained the brunt of the first round of Japanese combined arms fire.\\r\\nThese troops crossed the second terrace only to be confronted by\\r\\ntwo huge concrete pillboxes, still lethal despite all the pounding.\\r\\nOvercoming these positions proved costly in casualties and time. More\\r\\nfortified positions appeared in the broken ground beyond. Colonel\\r\\nWalter W. Wensinger’s call for tank support could not be immediately\\r\\nhonored because of trafficability and congestion problems on the beach.\\r\\nThe regiment clawed its way several hundred yards towards the eastern\\r\\nedge of the airstrip.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo assault units found it easy going to move inland, but the 25th\\r\\nMarines almost immediately ran into a buzz-saw trying to move across\\r\\nBlue Beach. General Cates had been right in his appraisal. “That\\r\\nright flank was a bitch if there ever was one,” he would later say.\\r\\nLieutenant Colonel Hollis W. Mustain’s 1st Battalion, 25th Marines,\\r\\nmanaged to scratch forward 300 yards under heavy fire in the first half\\r\\nhour, but Lieutenant Colonel Chambers’ 3d Battalion, 25th Marines, took\\r\\nthe heaviest beating of the day on the extreme right trying to scale\\r\\nthe cliffs leading to the Rock Quarry. Chambers landed 15 minutes after\\r\\nH-hour. “Crossing that second terrace,” he recalled, “the fire from\\r\\nautomatic weapons was coming from all over. You could’ve held up a\\r\\ncigarette and lit it on the stuff going by. I knew immediately we were\\r\\nin for one hell of a time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 110128\\r\\n\\r\\n_Tracked landing vehicles (LVTs), jam-packed with 4th Marine Division\\r\\ntroops, approach the Line of Departure at H-hour on D-day.

While the assault forces tried to\\r\\novercome the infantry weapons of the local defenders, they were\\r\\nnaturally blind to an almost imperceptible stirring taking place\\r\\namong the rocks and crevices of the interior highlands. With grim\\r\\nanticipation, General Kuribayashi’s gunners began unmasking the big\\r\\nguns--the heavy artillery, giant mortars, rockets, and anti-tank\\r\\nweapons held under tightest discipline for this precise moment.\\r\\nKuribayashi had patiently waited until the beaches were clogged with\\r\\ntroops and material. Gun crews knew the range and deflection to each\\r\\nlanding beach by heart; all weapons had been preregistered on these\\r\\ntargets long ago. At Kuribayashi’s signal, these hundreds of weapons\\r\\nbegan to open fire. It was shortly after 1000.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _H-hour at Iwo Jima, 19 February 1945._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USN) NH65311\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ensuing bombardment was as deadly and terrifying as any of\\r\\nthe Marines had ever experienced.

The profusion\\r\\nof combat veterans throughout the rank and file of each regiment\\r\\nhelped the rookies focus on the objective. Communications remained\\r\\neffective. Keen-eyed aerial observers spotted some of the now-exposed\\r\\ngun positions and directed naval gunfire effectively. Carrier planes\\r\\nscreeched in low to drop napalm canisters. The heavy Japanese fire\\r\\nwould continue to take an awful toll throughout the first day and\\r\\nnight, but it would never again be so murderous as that first unholy\\r\\nhour.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarine Sherman tanks played hell getting into action on D-day. Later\\r\\nin the battle these combat vehicles would be the most valuable weapons\\r\\non the battlefield for the Marines; this day was a nightmare. The\\r\\nassault divisions embarked many of their tanks on board medium landing\\r\\nships (LSMs), sturdy little craft that could deliver five Shermans at\\r\\na time. But it was tough disembarking them on Iwo’s steep beaches. The\\r\\nstern anchors could not hold in the loose sand; bow cables run forward\\r\\nto “deadmen” LVTs parted under the strain. On one occasion the lead\\r\\ntank stalled at the top of the ramp, blocking the other vehicles and\\r\\nleaving the LSM at the mercy of the rising surf. Other tanks bogged\\r\\ndown or threw tracks in the loose sand. Many of those that made it\\r\\nover the terraces were destroyed by huge horned mines or disabled by\\r\\ndeadly accurate 47mm anti-tank fire from Suribachi. Other tankers kept\\r\\ncoming. Their relative mobility, armored protection, and 75mm gunfire\\r\\nwere most welcome to the infantry scattered among Iwo’s lunar-looking,\\r\\nshell-pocked landscape.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Shore party Marines man steadying lines while others\\r\\nunload combat cargo from boats broached in the surf.

General Rockey\\r\\ncalled in the 26th Marines shortly after noon. General Cates ordered\\r\\ntwo battalions of the 24th Marines to land at 1400; the 3d Battalion,\\r\\n24th Marines, followed several hours later. Many of the reserve\\r\\nbattalions suffered heavier casualties crossing the beach than the\\r\\nassault units, a result of Kuribayashi’s punishing bombardment from all\\r\\npoints on the island.\\r\\n\\r\\nMindful of the likely Japanese counterattack in the night to come--and\\r\\ndespite the fire and confusion along the beaches--both divisions also\\r\\nordered their artillery regiments ashore. This process, frustrating\\r\\nand costly, took much of the afternoon. The wind and surf began to\\r\\npick up as the day wore on, causing more than one low-riding DUKW to\\r\\nswamp with its precious 105mm howitzer cargo. Getting the guns ashore\\r\\nwas one thing; getting them up off the sand was quite another. The\\r\\n75mm pack howitzers fared better than the heavier 105s. Enough Marines\\r\\ncould readily hustle them up over the terraces, albeit at great risk.\\r\\nThe 105s seemed to have a mind of their own in the black sand. The\\r\\neffort to get each single weapon off the beach was a saga in its own\\r\\nright. Somehow, despite the fire and unforgiving terrain, both Colonel\\r\\nLouis G. DeHaven, commanding the 14th Marines, and Colonel James D.\\r\\nWaller, commanding the 13th Marines, managed to get batteries in place,\\r\\nregistered, and rendering close fire support well before dark, a\\r\\nsingular accomplishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese fire and the plunging surf continued to make a shambles out of\\r\\nthe beachhead. Late in the afternoon, Lieutenant Michael F. Keleher,\\r\\nUSNR, the battalion surgeon, was ordered ashore to take over the 3d\\r\\nBattalion, 25th Marines aid station from its gravely wounded surgeon.\\r\\nKeleher, a veteran of three previous assault landings, was appalled\\r\\nby the carnage on Blue Beach as he approached: “Such a sight on that\\r\\nbeach! Wrecked boats, bogged-down jeeps, tractors and tanks; burning\\r\\nvehicles; casualties scattered all over.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Marine Corps Combat Art Collection\\r\\n\\r\\n_In “Flotsam and Jetsam,” an acrylic painting on masonite by Col\\r\\nCharles H.

Farther east, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Galer, the\\r\\nother Guadalcanal Medal of Honor Marine (and one of the Pacific War’s\\r\\nearliest fighter aces), survived the afternoon’s fusillade along the\\r\\nbeaches and began reassembling his scattered radar unit in a deep shell\\r\\nhole near the base of Suribachi.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 109601\\r\\n\\r\\n_As D-day on Iwo Jima comes to a close, the landing beaches are scenes\\r\\nof death and destruction with LVTs and landing craft wallowing in the\\r\\nwaves and tracked and wheeled vehicles kept out of action, unable to go\\r\\nforward._]\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in the afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel Donn J. Robertson led his\\r\\n3d Battalion, 27th Marines, ashore over Blue Beach, disturbed at the\\r\\nintensity of fire still being directed on the reserve forces this late\\r\\non D-day. “They were really ready for us,” he recalled. He watched with\\r\\npride and wonderment as his Marines landed under fire, took casualties,\\r\\nstumbled forward to clear the beach. “What impels a young guy landing\\r\\non a beach in the face of fire?” he asked himself. Then it was\\r\\nRobertson’s turn. His boat hit the beach too hard; the ramp wouldn’t\\r\\ndrop. Robertson and his command group had to roll over the gunwales\\r\\ninto the churning surf and crawl ashore, an inauspicious start.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bitter battle to capture the Rock Quarry cliffs on the right flank\\r\\nraged all day. The beachhead remained completely vulnerable to enemy\\r\\ndirect-fire weapons from these heights; the Marines had to storm them\\r\\nbefore many more troops or supplies could be landed. In the end, it\\r\\nwas the strength of character of Captain James Headley and Lieutenant\\r\\nColonel “Jumping Joe” Chambers who led the survivors of the 3d\\r\\nBattalion, 25th Marines, onto the top of the cliffs. The battalion paid\\r\\nan exorbitant price for this achievement, losing 22 officers and 500\\r\\ntroops by nightfall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two assistant division commanders, Brigadier Generals Franklin\\r\\nA. Hart and Leo D. Hermle, of the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions\\r\\nrespectively, spent much of D-day on board the control vessels marking\\r\\nboth ends of the Line of Departure, 4,000 yards off shore. This\\r\\nreflected yet another lesson in amphibious techniques learned from\\r\\nTarawa. Having senior officers that close to the ship-to-shore movement\\r\\nprovided landing force decision-making from the most forward vantage\\r\\npoint. By dusk General Hermle opted to come ashore. At Tarawa he had\\r\\nspent the night of D-day essentially out of contact at the fire-swept\\r\\npierhead. This time he intended to be on the ground. Hermle had the\\r\\nlarger operational picture in mind, knowing the corps commander’s\\r\\ndesire to force the reserves and artillery units on shore despite the\\r\\ncarnage in order to build credible combat power. Hermle knew that\\r\\nwhatever the night might bring, the Americans now had more troops on\\r\\nthe island than Kuribayashi could ever muster. His presence helped his\\r\\ndivision forget about the day’s disasters and focus on preparations for\\r\\nthe expected counterattacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese artillery and mortar fire continued to rake the beachhead.\\r\\nThe enormous spigot mortar shells (called “flying ashcans” by the\\r\\ntroops) and rocket-boosted aerial bombs were particularly scary--loud,\\r\\nwhistling projectiles, tumbling end over end. Many sailed completely\\r\\nover the island; those that hit along the beaches or the south runways\\r\\ninvariably caused dozens of casualties with each impact. Few Marines\\r\\ncould dig a proper foxhole in the granular sand (“like trying to dig a\\r\\nhole in a barrel of wheat”). Among urgent calls to the control ship for\\r\\nplasma, stretchers, and mortar shells came repeated cries for sand bags.\\r\\n\\r\\nVeteran Marine combat correspondent Lieutenant Cyril P. Zurlinden, soon\\r\\nto become a casualty himself, described that first night ashore:\\r\\n\\r\\n  At Tarawa, Saipan, and Tinian, I saw Marines killed and wounded\\r\\n  in a shocking manner, but I saw nothing like the ghastliness that\\r\\n  hung over the Iwo beachhead. Nothing any of us had ever known could\\r\\n  compare with the utter anguish, frustration, and constant inner\\r\\n  battle to maintain some semblance of sanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel accounting was a nightmare under those conditions, but the\\r\\nassault divisions eventually reported the combined loss of 2,420 men\\r\\nto General Schmidt (501 killed, 1,755 wounded, 47 dead of wounds, 18\\r\\nmissing, and 99 combat fatigue). These were sobering statistics, but\\r\\nSchmidt now had 30,000 Marines ashore. The casualty rate of eight\\r\\npercent left the landing force in relatively better condition than at\\r\\nthe first days at Tarawa or Saipan. The miracle was that the casualties\\r\\nhad not been twice as high. General Kuribayashi had possibly waited a\\r\\nlittle too long to open up with his big guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first night on Iwo was ghostly. Sulfuric mists spiraled out of\\r\\nthe earth. The Marines, used to the tropics, shivered in the cold,\\r\\nwaiting for Kuribayashi’s warriors to come screaming down from the\\r\\nhills. They would learn that this Japanese commander was different.\\r\\nThere would be no wasteful, vainglorious _Banzai_ attack, this night\\r\\nor any other. Instead, small teams of infiltrators, which Kuribayashi\\r\\ntermed “Prowling Wolves,” probed the lines, gathering intelligence.\\r\\nA barge-full of Japanese _Special Landing Forces_ tried a small\\r\\ncounterlanding on the western beaches and died to the man under the\\r\\nalert guns of the 28th Marines and its supporting LVT crews. Otherwise\\r\\nthe night was one of continuing waves of indirect fire from the\\r\\nhighlands. One high velocity round landed directly in the hole occupied\\r\\nby the 1st Battalion, 23d Marines’ commander, Lieutenant Colonel Ralph\\r\\nHaas, killing him instantly. The Marines took casualties throughout the\\r\\nnight. But with the first streaks of dawn, the veteran landing force\\r\\nstirred. Five infantry regiments looked north; a sixth turned to the\\r\\nbusiness at hand in the south: Mount Suribachi.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidebar (page 10): The Assault Commanders at Iwo Jima\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFour veteran Marine major generals led the sustained assault on Iwo\\r\\nJima: Harry Schmidt, Commanding General, V Amphibious Corps; Graves\\r\\nB.

He was a native of Holdrege, Nebraska, and attended Nebraska\\r\\nNormal College. Expeditionary assignments kept him from service in\\r\\nWorld War I, but Schmidt saw considerable small unit action in Guam,\\r\\nChina, the Philippines, Mexico, Cuba, and Nicaragua, plus four years\\r\\nat sea. He attended the Army Command and General Staff College and\\r\\nthe Marine Corps Field Officers’ Course. In World War II, General\\r\\nSchmidt commanded the 4th Marine Division in the Roi-Namur and Saipan\\r\\noperations, then assumed command of V Amphibious Corps for the Tinian\\r\\nlanding. At Iwo Jima he would command the largest force of Marines ever\\r\\ncommitted to a single battle. “It was the highest honor of my life,” he\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _MajGen Graves B.

He had served 28 years on active duty by that time.\\r\\nA native of Columbia, Louisiana, he graduated from Louisiana State\\r\\nUniversity, received a Marine Corps commission, and immediately\\r\\ndeployed overseas for duty in World War I. As a platoon commander in\\r\\nthe 6th Marines, Erskine saw combat at Belleau Wood, Chateau-Thierry,\\r\\nSoissons, and St. Mihiel, during which he was twice wounded and awarded\\r\\nthe Silver Star. In the inter-war years he served in Haiti, Santo\\r\\nDomingo, Nicaragua, Cuba, and China. He attended the Army Infantry\\r\\nSchool and the Army Command and General Staff College. In World War II,\\r\\nErskine was chief of staff to General Holland M. Smith during campaigns\\r\\nin the Aleutians, Gilberts, Marshalls, and Marianas. He assumed command\\r\\nof the 3d Marine Division in October 1944.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _MajGen Clifton B.

He was one of the few Marine Corps general officers who\\r\\nheld combat command at the platoon, company, battalion, regiment,\\r\\nand division levels in his career. Cates was born in Tiptonville,\\r\\nTennessee, and attended the University of Tennessee. In World War I,\\r\\nhe served as a junior officer in the 6th Marines at Belleau Wood,\\r\\nSoissons, St. Mihiel, and Blanc Mont, and was awarded the Navy Cross,\\r\\ntwo Silver Stars, and two Purple Hearts for his service and his wounds.\\r\\nBetween wars, he served at sea and twice in China. He attended the Army\\r\\nIndustrial College, the Senior Course at Marine Corps Schools, and\\r\\nthe Army War College. In World War II he commanded the 1st Marines at\\r\\nGuadalcanal and the 4th Marine Division at Tinian. Three years after\\r\\nIwo Jima, General Cates became the 19th Commandant of the Marine Corps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _MajGen Keller E.

He was awarded the\\r\\nNavy Cross as a junior officer in the 5th Marines at Chateau-Thierry. A\\r\\nsecond Navy Cross came later for heroic service in Nicaragua. He also\\r\\nserved in Haiti and two years at sea. He attended the Field Officers’\\r\\nCourse at Quantico and the Army Command and General Staff Course. He\\r\\nspent the first years of World War II at Headquarters Marine Corps in\\r\\nWashington, first as Director, Division of Plans and Policies, then as\\r\\nAssistant Commandant. In February 1944 General Rockey assumed command\\r\\nof the 5th Marine Division and began preparing the new organization for\\r\\nits first, and last, great battle of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree Marine brigadier generals also played significant roles in the\\r\\namphibious seizure of Iwo Jima: William W. Rogers, corps chief of\\r\\nstaff; Franklin A. Hart, assistant division commander, 4th Marine\\r\\nDivision; and Leo D. Hermle, assistant division commander, 5th Marine\\r\\nDivision.\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Suribachi_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese called the dormant volcano Suribachi-yama; the Marines\\r\\ndubbed it “Hotrocks.” From the start the Marines knew their drive north\\r\\nwould never succeed without first seizing that hulking rock dominating\\r\\nthe southern plain. “Suribachi seemed to take on a life of its own,\\r\\nto be watching these men, looming over them,” recalled one observer,\\r\\nadding “the mountain represented to these Marines a thing more evil\\r\\nthan the Japanese.”\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Kanehiko Atsuchi commanded the 2,000 soldiers and sailors of\\r\\nthe Suribachi garrison. The Japanese had honeycombed the mountain with\\r\\ngun positions, machine-gun nests, observation sites, and tunnels, but\\r\\nAtsuchi had lost many of his large-caliber guns in the direct naval\\r\\nbombardment of the preceding three days. General Kuribayashi considered\\r\\nAtsuchi’s command to be semiautonomous, realizing the invaders would\\r\\nsoon cut communications across the island’s narrow southern tip.\\r\\nKuribayashi nevertheless hoped Suribachi could hold out for 10 days,\\r\\nmaybe two weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of Suribachi’s stoutest defenses existed down low, around the\\r\\nrubble-strewn base. Here nearly 70 camouflaged concrete blockhouses\\r\\nprotected the approaches to the mountain; another 50 bulged from the\\r\\nslopes within the first hundred feet of elevation. Then came the caves,\\r\\nthe first of hundreds the Marines would face on Iwo Jima.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 28th Marines had suffered nearly 400 casualties in cutting\\r\\nacross the neck of the island on D-day. On D+1, in a cold rain, they\\r\\nprepared to assault the mountain. Lieutenant Colonel Chandler Johnson,\\r\\ncommanding the 2d Battalion, 28th Marines, set the tone for the morning\\r\\nas he deployed his tired troops forward: “It’s going to be a hell of a\\r\\nday in a hell of a place to fight the damned war!” Some of the 105mm\\r\\nbatteries of the 13th Marines opened up in support, firing directly\\r\\noverhead. Gun crews fired from positions hastily dug in the black sand\\r\\ndirectly next to the 28th Marines command post. Regimental Executive\\r\\nOfficer Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Williams watched the cannoneers\\r\\nfire at Suribachi “eight hundred yards away over open sights.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _A dug-in Marine 81mm mortar crew places continuous fire\\r\\non Japanese positions around the slopes of Mount Suribachi preparatory\\r\\nto the attack of the 28th Marines._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 109861\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Marines would learn during their drive north, even 105mm\\r\\nhowitzers would hardly shiver the concrete pillboxes of the enemy.\\r\\nAs the prep fire lifted, the infantry leapt forward, only to run\\r\\nimmediately into very heavy machine-gun and mortar fire. Colonel\\r\\nHarry B. “Harry the Horse” Liversedge bellowed for his tanks. But\\r\\nthe 5th Tank Battalion was already having a frustrating morning. The\\r\\ntankers sought a defilade spot in which to rearm and refuel for the\\r\\nday’s assault. Such a location did not exist on Iwo Jima those first\\r\\ndays. Every time the tanks congregated to service their vehicles they\\r\\nwere hit hard by Japanese mortar and artillery fire from virtually the\\r\\nentire island. Getting sufficient vehicles serviced to join the assault\\r\\ntook most of the morning. Hereafter the tankers would maintain and\\r\\nre-equip their vehicles at night.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Colonel William P. McCahill Collection\\r\\n\\r\\n_The crew of the Sherman tank “Cairo” awaits a repair crew to replace\\r\\nits tread after it hit a Japanese mine. Note wooden sheathing on sides\\r\\nof vehicle to protect against magnetic mines. Damaged vehicles became\\r\\nprime enemy targets._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis day’s slow start led to more setbacks for the tankers; Japanese\\r\\nantitank gunners hiding in the jumbled boulders knocked out the first\\r\\napproaching Shermans. Assault momentum slowed further. The 28th Marines\\r\\noverran 40 strongpoints and gained roughly 200 yards all day. They\\r\\nlost a Marine for every yard gained. The tankers unknowingly redeemed\\r\\nthemselves when one of their final 75mm rounds caught Colonel Atsuchi\\r\\nas he peered out of a cave entrance, killing him instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere, the morning light on D+1 revealed the discouraging sights of\\r\\nthe chaos created along the beaches by the combination of Iwo Jima’s\\r\\nwicked surf and Kuribayashi’s unrelenting barrages. In the words of one\\r\\ndismayed observer:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The wreckage was indescribable. For two miles the debris was\\r\\n  so thick that there were only a few places where landing craft\\r\\n  could still get in. The wrecked hulls of scores of landing boats\\r\\n  testified to one price we had to pay to put our troops ashore.\\r\\n  Tanks and half-tracks lay crippled where they had bogged down\\r\\n  in the coarse sand. Amphibian tractors, victims of mines and\\r\\n  well-aimed shells, lay flopped on their backs. Cranes, brought\\r\\n  ashore to unload cargo, tilted at insane angles, and bulldozers\\r\\n  were smashed in their own roadways.\\r\\n\\r\\nBad weather set in, further compounding the problems of general\\r\\nunloading. Strong winds whipped sea swells into a nasty chop; the surf\\r\\nturned uglier. These were the conditions faced by Lieutenant Colonel\\r\\nCarl A. Youngdale in trying to land the 105mm-howitzer batteries of\\r\\nhis 4th Battalion, 14th Marines. All 12 of these guns were preloaded\\r\\nin DUKWs, one to a vehicle. Added to the amphibious trucks’ problems\\r\\nof marginal seaworthiness with that payload was contaminated fuel. As\\r\\nYoungdale watched in horror, eight DUKWs suffered engine failures,\\r\\nswamped, and sank with great loss of life. Two more DUKWs broached\\r\\nin the surf zone, spilling their invaluable guns into deep water. At\\r\\nlength Youngdale managed to get his remaining two guns ashore and into\\r\\nfiring position.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 110319\\r\\n\\r\\n_Like some recently killed prehistoric monsters, these LVTs lie on\\r\\ntheir sides, completely destroyed on the beach by Japanese mines and\\r\\nheavy artillery fire._]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Schmidt also committed one battery of 155mm howitzers of the\\r\\ncorps artillery to the narrow beachhead on D+1. Somehow these weapons\\r\\nmanaged to reach the beach intact, but it then took hours to get\\r\\ntractors to drag the heavy guns up over the terraces. These, too,\\r\\ncommenced firing before dark, their deep bark a welcome sound to the\\r\\ninfantry.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcern with the heavy casualties in the first 24 hours led Schmidt to\\r\\ncommit the 21st Marines from corps reserve. The seas proved to be too\\r\\nrough. The troops had harrowing experiences trying to debark down cargo\\r\\nnets into the small boats bobbing violently alongside the transports;\\r\\nseveral fell into the water. The boating process took hours. Once\\r\\nafloat, the troops circled endlessly in their small Higgins boats,\\r\\nwaiting for the call to land. Wiser heads prevailed. After six hours of\\r\\nawful seasickness, the 21st Marines returned to its ships for the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the larger landing craft, the LCTs and LSMs, had great difficulty\\r\\nbeaching. Sea anchors needed to maintain the craft perpendicular to\\r\\nthe breakers rarely held fast in the steep, soft bottom. “Dropping\\r\\nthose stern anchors was like dropping a spoon in a bowl of mush,” said\\r\\nAdmiral Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nHill contributed significantly to the development of amphibious\\r\\nexpertise in the Pacific War. For Iwo Jima, he and his staff developed\\r\\narmored bulldozers to land in the assault waves. They also experimented\\r\\nwith hinged Marston matting, used for expeditionary airfields, as a\\r\\ntemporary roadway to get wheeled vehicles over soft sand. On the beach\\r\\nat Iwo, the bulldozers proved to be worth their weights in gold. The\\r\\nMarston matting was only partially successful--LVTs kept chewing it up\\r\\nin passage--but all hands could see its potential.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _“Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,” acrylic on\\r\\nmasonite, is by Col Charles H. Waterhouse, wounded in his arm on D+2\\r\\nand evacuated from Iwo Jima._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Marine Corps Combat Art Collection\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral Hill also worked with the Naval Construction Battalion (NCB)\\r\\npersonnel, Seabees, as they were called, in the attempt to bring\\r\\nsupply-laden causeways and pontoon barges ashore. Again the surf\\r\\nprevailed, broaching the craft, spilling the cargo. In desperation,\\r\\nHill’s beachmasters turned to round-the-clock use of DUKWs and LVTs to\\r\\nkeep combat cargo flowing. Once the DUKWs got free of the crippling\\r\\nload of 105mm howitzers they did fine. LVTs were probably better,\\r\\nbecause they could cross the soft beach without assistance and conduct\\r\\nresupply or medevac missions directly along the front lines. Both\\r\\nvehicles suffered from inexperienced LST crews in the transport area\\r\\nwho too often would not lower their bow ramps to accommodate LVTs or\\r\\nDUKWs approaching after dark. In too many cases, vehicles loaded with\\r\\nwounded Marines thus rejected became lost in the darkness, ran out of\\r\\ngas and sank. The amphibian tractor battalions lost 148 LVTs at Iwo\\r\\nJima. Unlike Tarawa, Japanese gunfire and mines accounted for less\\r\\nthan 20 percent of this total. Thirty-four LVTs fell victim to Iwo’s\\r\\ncrushing surf; 88 sank in deep water, mostly at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce ashore and clear of the loose sand along the beaches, the tanks,\\r\\nhalf-tracks, and armored bulldozers of the landing force ran into\\r\\nthe strongest minefield defenses yet encountered in the Pacific War.\\r\\nUnder General Kuribayashi’s direction, Japanese engineers had planted\\r\\nirregular rows of antitank mines and the now-familiar horned antiboat\\r\\nmines along all possible exits from both beaches. The Japanese\\r\\nsupplemented these weapons by rigging enormous makeshift explosives\\r\\nfrom 500-pound aerial bombs, depth charges, and torpedo heads, each\\r\\ntriggered by an accompanying pressure mine. Worse, Iwo’s loose soil\\r\\nretained enough metallic characteristics to render the standard mine\\r\\ndetectors unreliable. The Marines were reduced to using their own\\r\\nengineers on their hands and knees out in front of the tanks, probing\\r\\nfor mines with bayonets and wooden sticks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the 28th Marines fought to encircle Suribachi and the\\r\\nbeachmasters and shore party attempted to clear the wreckage from\\r\\nthe beaches, the remaining assault units of the VAC resumed their\\r\\ncollective assault against Airfield No. 1. In the 5th Marine Division’s\\r\\nzone, the relatively fresh troops of the 1st Battalion, 26th Marines,\\r\\nand the 3d Battalion, 27th Marines, quickly became bloodied in forcing\\r\\ntheir way across the western runways, taking heavy casualties from\\r\\ntime-fuzed air bursts fired by Japanese dual-purpose antiaircraft guns\\r\\nzeroed along the exposed ground. In the adjacent 4th Division zone, the\\r\\n23d Marines completed the capture of the airstrip, advancing 800 yards\\r\\nbut sustaining high losses.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Marine Corps Historical Collection\\r\\n\\r\\n_Marines advance warily on Airfield No. 1 towards wrecked Japanese\\r\\nplanes in which enemy snipers are suspected of hiding. The assault\\r\\nquickly moved on._]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the bitterest fighting in the initial phase of the landing\\r\\ncontinued to occur along the high ground above the Rock Quarry on the\\r\\nright flank. Here the 25th Marines, reinforced by the 1st Battalion,\\r\\n24th Marines, engaged in literally the fight of its life. The Marines\\r\\nfound the landscape, and the Japanese embedded in it, unreal:\\r\\n\\r\\n  There was no cover from enemy fire. Japs dug in reinforced concrete\\r\\n  pillboxes laid down interlocking bands of fire that cut whole\\r\\n  companies to ribbons. Camouflage hid all enemy positions. The high\\r\\n  ground on either side was honeycombed with layer after layer of Jap\\r\\n  emplacements.... Their observation was perfect; whenever a Marine\\r\\n  made a move, the Japs would smother the area in a murderous blanket\\r\\n  of fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second day of the battle had proven unsatisfactory on virtually\\r\\nevery front. To cap off the frustration, when the 1st Battalion, 24th\\r\\nMarines, finally managed a breakthrough along the cliffs late in the\\r\\nday their only reward was two back-to-back cases of “friendly fire.” An\\r\\nAmerican air strike inflicted 11 casualties; misguided salvos from an\\r\\nunidentified gunfire support ship took down 90 more. Nothing seemed to\\r\\nbe going right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning of the third day, D+2, seemed to promise more of the same\\r\\nfrustrations. Marines shivered in the cold wind and rain; Admiral Hill\\r\\ntwice had to close the beach due to high surf and dangerous undertows.\\r\\nBut during one of the grace periods, the 3d Division’s 21st Marines\\r\\nmanaged to come ashore, all of it extremely glad to be free of the\\r\\nheaving small boats. General Schmidt assigned it to the 4th Marine\\r\\nDivision at first.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 28th Marines resumed its assault on the base of Suribachi, more\\r\\nslow, bloody fighting, seemingly boulder by boulder. On the west coast,\\r\\nthe 1st Battalion, 28th Marines, made the most of field artillery and\\r\\nnaval gunfire support to reach the shoulder of the mountain. Elsewhere,\\r\\nmurderous Japanese fire restricted any progress to a matter of yards.\\r\\nEnemy mortar fire from all over the volcano rained down on the 2d\\r\\nBattalion, 28th Marines, trying to advance along the eastern shore.\\r\\nRecalled rifleman Richard Wheeler of the experience, “It was terrible,\\r\\nthe worst I can remember us taking. The Jap mortarmen seemed to be\\r\\nplaying checkers and using us as squares.” The Marines used Weasels,\\r\\nhandy little tracked vehicles making their first field appearance in\\r\\nthis battle, to hustle forward flame-thrower canisters and evacuate\\r\\nsome of the many wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Colonel William P.

When they fell, others took their places._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night the amphibious task force experienced the only significant\\r\\nair attack of the battle. Fifty _kamikaze_ pilots from the _22d Mitate\\r\\nSpecial Attack Unit_ left Katori Airbase near Yokosuka and flung\\r\\nthemselves against the ships on the outer perimeter of Iwo Jima. In\\r\\ndesperate action that would serve as a prelude to Okinawa’s fiery\\r\\nengagements, the _kamikazes_ sank the escort carrier _Bismarck Sea_\\r\\nwith heavy loss of life and damaged several other ships, including the\\r\\nveteran _Saratoga_, finally knocked out of the war. All 50 Japanese\\r\\nplanes were expended.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt rained even harder on the fourth morning, D+3. Marines scampering\\r\\nforward under fire would hit the deck, roll, attempt to return\\r\\nfire--only to discover that the loose volcanic grit had combined with\\r\\nthe rain to jam their weapons. The 21st Marines, as the vanguard\\r\\nof the 3d Marine Division, hoped for good fortune in its initial\\r\\ncommitment after relieving the 23d Marines. The regiment instead ran\\r\\nheadlong into an intricate series of Japanese emplacements which marked\\r\\nthe southeastern end of the main Japanese defenses. The newcomers\\r\\nfought hard all day to scratch and claw an advance of 200 net yards.\\r\\nCasualties were disproportionate.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _In the attack of the 28th Marines on the dominating\\r\\nheight, a 37mm guncrew fires at caves at the foot of Suribachi\\r\\nsuspected of holding Japanese gun positions._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 110139\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the right flank, Lieutenant Colonel Chambers continued to rally\\r\\nthe 3d Battalion, 25th Marines, through the rough pinnacles above the\\r\\nRock Quarry. As he strode about directing the advance of his decimated\\r\\ncompanies that afternoon, a Japanese gunner shot him through the chest.\\r\\nChambers went down hard, thinking it was all over:\\r\\n\\r\\n  I started fading in and out. I don’t remember too much about it\\r\\n  except the frothy blood gushing out of my mouth.... Then somebody\\r\\n  started kicking the hell out of my feet. It was [Captain James]\\r\\n  Headley saying, “Get up, you were hurt worse on Tulagi!”\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Headley knew Chambers’ sucking chest wound portended a grave\\r\\ninjury; he sought to reduce his commander’s shock until they could get\\r\\nhim out of the line of fire. This took doing. Lieutenant Michael F.\\r\\nKeleher, USNR, now the battalion surgeon, crawled forward with one of\\r\\nhis corpsmen. Willing hands lifted Chambers on a stretcher. Keleher\\r\\nand several others, bent double against the fire, carried him down\\r\\nthe cliffs to the aid station and eventually on board a DUKW making\\r\\nthe evening’s last run out to the hospital ships. All three battalion\\r\\ncommanders in the 25th Marines had now become casualties. Chambers\\r\\nwould survive to receive the Medal of Honor; Captain Headley would\\r\\ncommand the shot-up 3d Battalion, 25th Marines, for the duration of the\\r\\nbattle.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 110177\\r\\n\\r\\n_From the time of the landing on Iwo Jima, attacking Marines seemed to\\r\\nbe moving uphill constantly.

Late in the day combat\\r\\npatrols from the 1st Battalion, 28th Marines, and the 2d Battalion,\\r\\n28th Marines, linked up at Tobiishi Point at the southern tip of the\\r\\nisland. Recon patrols returned to tell Lieutenant Colonel Johnson that\\r\\nthey found few signs of live Japanese along the mountain’s upper slopes\\r\\non the northside.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt sundown Admiral Spruance authorized Task Force 58 to strike Honshu\\r\\nand Okinawa, then retire to Ulithi to prepare for the Ryukyuan\\r\\ncampaign. All eight Marine Corps fighter squadrons thus left the Iwo\\r\\nJima area for good. Navy pilots flying off the 10 remaining escort\\r\\ncarriers would pick up the slack. Without slighting the skill and\\r\\nvalor of these pilots, the quality of close air support to the troops\\r\\nfighting ashore dropped off after this date. The escort carriers, for\\r\\none thing, had too many competing missions, namely combat air patrols,\\r\\nanti-submarine sweeps, searches for downed aviators, harassing strikes\\r\\nagainst neighboring Chichi Jima. Marines on Iwo Jima complained of slow\\r\\nresponse time to air support requests, light payloads (rarely greater\\r\\nthan 100-pound bombs), and high delivery altitudes (rarely below 1,500\\r\\nfeet). The Navy pilots did deliver a number of napalm bombs. Many\\r\\nof these failed to detonate, although this was not the fault of the\\r\\naviators; the early napalm “bombs” were simply old wing-tanks filled\\r\\nwith the mixture, activated by unreliable detonators. The Marines also\\r\\ngrew concerned about these notoriously inaccurate area weapons being\\r\\ndropped from high altitudes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Friday, 23 February (D+4), the 28th Marines stood poised to complete\\r\\nthe capture of Mount Suribachi. The honor went to the 3d Platoon\\r\\n(reinforced), Company E, 2d Battalion, 28th Marines, under the command\\r\\nof First Lieutenant Harold G. Schrier, the company executive officer.\\r\\nLieutenant Colonel Johnson ordered Schrier to scale the summit, secure\\r\\nthe crater, and raise a 54″×28″ American flag for all to see. Schrier\\r\\nled his 40-man patrol forward at 0800. The regiment had done its job,\\r\\nblasting the dozens of pillboxes with flame and demolitions, rooting\\r\\nout snipers, knocking out the masked batteries. The combined-arms\\r\\npounding by planes, field pieces, and naval guns the past week had\\r\\nlikewise taken its toll on the defenders. Those who remained popped out\\r\\nof holes and caves to resist Schrier’s advance only to be cut down. The\\r\\nMarines worked warily up the steep northern slope, sometimes resorting\\r\\nto crawling on hands and knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the enduring drama of the Suribachi flag-raising was the fact\\r\\nthat it was observed by so many people. Marines all over the island\\r\\ncould track the progress of the tiny column of troops during its ascent\\r\\n(“those guys oughta be getting flight pay,” said one wag). Likewise,\\r\\nhundreds of binoculars from the ships offshore watched Schrier’s\\r\\nMarines climbing ever upward. Finally they reached the top and\\r\\nmomentarily disappeared from view. Those closest to the volcano could\\r\\nhear distant gunfire. Then, at 1020, there was movement on the summit;\\r\\nsuddenly the Stars and Stripes fluttered bravely.\\r\\n\\r\\nLusty cheers rang out from all over the southern end of the island. The\\r\\nships sounded their sirens and whistles. Wounded men propped themselves\\r\\nup on their litters to glimpse the sight. Strong men wept unashamedly.\\r\\nNavy Secretary Forrestal, thrilled by the sight, turned to Holland\\r\\nSmith and said, “the raising of that flag means a Marine Corps for\\r\\nanother five hundred years.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThree hours later an even larger flag went up to more cheers. Few\\r\\nwould know that Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal had just\\r\\ncaptured the embodiment of the American warfighting spirit on film.\\r\\n_Leatherneck_ magazine photographer Staff Sergeant Lou Lowery had\\r\\ntaken a picture of the first flag-raising and almost immediately got\\r\\nin a firefight with a couple of enraged Japanese. His photograph would\\r\\nbecome a valued collector’s item. But Rosenthal’s would enthrall the\\r\\nfree world.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Thomas M. Fields, commanding Company D, 1st Battalion, 26th\\r\\nMarines, heard his men yell “Look up there!” and turned in time to see\\r\\nthe first flag go up. His first thought dealt with the battle still at\\r\\nhand: “Thank God the Japs won’t be shooting us down from behind any\\r\\nmore.” Meanwhile, the 14th Marines rushed their echo and flash-ranging\\r\\nequipment up to the summit. The landing force sorely needed enhanced\\r\\ncounterbattery fire against Kuribayashi’s big guns to the north.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marines who raised the first flag were Lieutenant Schrier; Platoon\\r\\nSergeant Ernest T. Thomas, Jr.; Sergeant Henry O. Hansen; Corporal\\r\\nCharles W. Lindberg; and Privates First Class Louis C. Charlo and James\\r\\nMichels. The six men immortalized by Joe Rosenthal’s photograph of the\\r\\nsecond flag-raising were Sergeant Michael Strank, Pharmacist’s Mate 2/c\\r\\nJohn H. Bradley, Corporal Harlon H. Block, and Privates First Class Ira\\r\\nH. Hayes, Franklin R. Sousley, and Rene A. Gagnon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 28th Marines took Suribachi in three days at the cost of more than\\r\\n500 troops (added to its D-day losses of 400 men). Colonel Liversedge\\r\\nbegan to reorient his regiment for operations in the opposite\\r\\ndirection, northward. Unknown to all, the battle still had another\\r\\nmonth to run its bloody course.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidebar (page 26): Rosenthal’s Photograph of Iwo Jima Flag-Raising\\r\\nQuickly Became One of the War’s Most Famous\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _The six men who participated in the second or “famous”\\r\\nflag-raising on Mount Suribachi were Marines, joined by a medical\\r\\ncorpsman.

AP photographer Joe Rosenthal recalls\\r\\nstumbling on the picture accidentally: “I swung my camera around and\\r\\nheld it until I could guess that this was the peak of the action,\\r\\nand shot.... Had I posed that shot, I would, of course, have ruined\\r\\nit.... I would have also made them turn their heads so that they could\\r\\nbe identified ... and nothing like the existing picture would have\\r\\nresulted.”_\\r\\n\\r\\n    Associated Press\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two flags raised over Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima, but not\\r\\nat the same time. Despite the beliefs of many, and contrary to the\\r\\nsupposed evidence, none of the photographs of the two flag-raisings\\r\\nwas posed. To begin with, early on the morning of 23 February 1945,\\r\\nfour days after the initial landings, Captain Dave E. Severance, the\\r\\ncommander of Company E, 2d Battalion, 28th Marines, ordered Lieutenant\\r\\nHarold G. Schrier to take a patrol and an American flag to the top of\\r\\nSuribachi. Staff Sergeant Louis R. Lowery, a _Leatherneck_ magazine\\r\\nphotographer, accompanied the patrol. After a short fire fight, the\\r\\n54″-by-28″ flag was attached to a long piece of pipe, found at the\\r\\ncrest of the mountain, and raised. This is the flag-raising which\\r\\nLowery photographed. As the flag was thought to be too small to be\\r\\nseen from the beach below, another Marine from the battalion went on\\r\\nboard _LST 779_ to obtain a larger flag. A second patrol then took\\r\\nthis flag up to Suribachi’s top and Joe Rosenthal, an Associated Press\\r\\nphotographer, who had just come ashore, accompanied it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Rosenthal noted in his oral history interview, “... my stumbling on\\r\\nthat picture was, in all respects, accidental.” When he got to the top\\r\\nof the mountain, he stood in a decline just below the crest of the hill\\r\\nwith Marine Sergeant William Genaust, a movie cameraman who was killed\\r\\nlater in the campaign, watching while a group of five Marines and a\\r\\nNavy corpsman fastened the new flag to another piece of pipe. Rosenthal\\r\\nsaid that he turned from Genaust and out of the corner of his eye saw\\r\\nthe second flag being raised. He said, “Hey, Bill. There it goes.” He\\r\\ncontinued: “I swung my camera around and held it until I could guess\\r\\nthat this was the peak of the action, and shot.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people learned that Rosenthal’s photograph was of a second\\r\\nflag-raising and made the accusation that it was posed. Joe Rosenthal:\\r\\n“Had I posed that shot, I would, of course, have ruined it.... I would\\r\\nhave also made them turn their heads so that they could be identified\\r\\nfor [Associated Press] members throughout the country, and nothing like\\r\\nthe existing picture would have resulted.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in the interview, he said: “This picture, what it means to\\r\\nme--and it has a meaning to me--that has to be peculiar only to me\\r\\n... I see all that blood running down the sand. I see those awful,\\r\\nimpossible positions to take in a frontal attack on such an island,\\r\\nwhere the batteries opposing you are not only staggered up in front\\r\\nof you, but also standing around at the sides as you’re coming on\\r\\nshore. The awesome situation, before they ever reach that peak. Now,\\r\\nthat a photograph can serve to remind us of the contribution of those\\r\\nboys--that was what made it important, not who took it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRosenthal took 18 photographs that day, went down to the beach to\\r\\nwrite captions for his undeveloped film packs, and, as the other\\r\\nphotographers on the island, sent his films out to the command vessel\\r\\noffshore. From there they were flown to Guam, where the headquarters of\\r\\nAdmiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet/Commander\\r\\nin Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, was situated, and where the photos were\\r\\nprocessed and censored. Rosenthal’s pictures arrived at Guam before\\r\\nLowery’s, were processed, sent to the States for distribution, and his\\r\\nflag-raising picture became one of the most famous photographs ever\\r\\ntaken in the war, or in any war.--_Benis M. Frank_\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Drive North_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landing force still had much to learn about its opponent. Senior\\r\\nintelligence officers did not realize until 27 February, the ninth day\\r\\nof the battle, that General Kuribayashi was in fact on Iwo Jima, or\\r\\nthat his fighters actually numbered half again the original estimate of\\r\\n13,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Kuribayashi, the unexpectedly early loss of the Suribachi garrison\\r\\nrepresented a setback, yet he occupied a position of great strength.\\r\\nHe still had the equivalent of eight infantry battalions, a tank\\r\\nregiment, two artillery and three heavy mortar battalions, plus the\\r\\n5,000 gunners and naval infantry under his counterpart, Rear Admiral\\r\\nToshinosuke Ichimaru. Unlike other besieged garrisons in the Central\\r\\nPacific, the two Japanese services on Iwo Jima functioned well together.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Marine Corps Historical Collection\\r\\n\\r\\n_Marine half-track scores a hit on a Japanese strongpoint with its 75mm\\r\\ngun._]\\r\\n\\r\\nKuribayashi was particularly pleased with the quality of his artillery\\r\\nand engineering troops. Colonel Chosaku Kaido served as Chief of\\r\\nArtillery from his seemingly impregnable concrete blockhouse on a\\r\\npromontory on the east central sector of the Motoyama Plateau, a lethal\\r\\nlandmark the Marines soon dubbed “Turkey Knob.” Major General Sadasue\\r\\nSenda, a former artillery officer with combat experience in China and\\r\\nManchuria, commanded the _2d Independent Mixed Brigade_, whose main\\r\\nunits would soon be locked into a 25-day death struggle with the 4th\\r\\nMarine Division. Kuribayashi knew that the _204th Naval Construction\\r\\nBattalion_ had built some of the most daunting defensive systems on\\r\\nthe island in that sector. One cave had a tunnel 800 feet long with 14\\r\\nseparate exits; it was one of hundreds designed to be defended in depth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese defenders waiting for the advance of the V Amphibious\\r\\nCorps were well armed and confident. Occasionally Kuribayashi\\r\\nauthorized company-sized spoiling attacks to recapture lost terrain\\r\\nor disrupt enemy assault preparations. These were not suicidal or\\r\\nsacrificial. Most were preceded by stinging artillery and mortar\\r\\nfires and aimed at limited objectives. Kuribayashi’s iron will kept\\r\\nhis troops from large-scale, wasteful _Banzai_ attacks until the last\\r\\ndays. One exception occurred the night of 8 March when General Senda\\r\\ngrew so frustrated at the tightening noose being applied by the 4th\\r\\nMarine Division that he led 800 of his surviving troops in a ferocious\\r\\ncounterattack. Finally given a multitude of open targets, the Marines\\r\\ncut them down in a lingering melee.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first week of the drive north, the Japanese on Iwo Jima\\r\\nactually had the attacking Marines outgunned. Japanese 150mm howitzers\\r\\nand 120mm mortars were superior to most of the weapons of the landing\\r\\nforce. The Marines found the enemy direct fire weapons to be equally\\r\\ndeadly, especially the dual-purpose antiaircraft guns and the 47mm\\r\\ntank guns, buried and camouflaged up to their turrets. “The Japs could\\r\\n_snipe_ with those big guns,” said retired Lieutenant General Donn J.\\r\\nRobertson. The defenders also had the advantage of knowing the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _The drive north by the 3d Battalion, 28th Marines,\\r\\nenters rugged terrain. Under heavy Japanese fire, this attack netted\\r\\nonly 200 yards despite supporting fires._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 111988\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot surprisingly, most casualties in the first three weeks of the\\r\\nbattle resulted from high explosives: mortars, artillery, mines,\\r\\ngrenades, and the hellacious rocket bombs. _Time_ correspondent Robert\\r\\nSherrod reported that the dead at Iwo Jima, both Japanese and American,\\r\\nhad one thing in common: “They all died with the greatest possible\\r\\nviolence. Nowhere in the Pacific War had I seen such badly mangled\\r\\nbodies. Many were cut squarely in half.”\\r\\n\\r\\nClose combat was rough enough; on Iwo Jima the stress seemed endless\\r\\nbecause for a long time the Marines had no secure “rear area” in which\\r\\nto give shot-up troop units a respite. Kuribayashi’s gunners throughout\\r\\nthe Motoyama Plateau could still bracket the beaches and airfields.\\r\\nThe enormous spigot mortar shells and rocket bombs still came tumbling\\r\\nout of the sky. Japanese infiltrators were drawn to “softer targets”\\r\\nin the rear. Anti-personnel mines and booby traps, encountered here on\\r\\na large scale for the first time in the Pacific, seemed everywhere.\\r\\nExhausted troop units would stumble out of the front lines seeking\\r\\nnothing more than a helmet-full of water in which to bathe and a deep\\r\\nhole in which to sleep. Too often the men had to spend their rare\\r\\nrest periods repairing weapons, humping ammo, dodging major-caliber\\r\\nincoming, or having to repel yet another nocturnal Japanese probe.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Schmidt planned to attack the Japanese positions in the north\\r\\nwith three divisions abreast, the 5th on the left, the 3d (less the 3d\\r\\nMarines) in the center, and the 4th on the right, along the east coast.\\r\\nThe drive north officially began on D+5, the day after the capture of\\r\\nSuribachi. Prep fires along the high ground immediately north of the\\r\\nsecond airfield extended for a full hour. Then three regimental combat\\r\\nteams moved out abreast, the 26th Marines on the left, the 24th Marines\\r\\non the right, and the 21st Marines again in the middle. For this\\r\\nattack, General Schmidt consolidated the Sherman tanks of all three\\r\\ndivisions into one armored task force commanded by Lieutenant Colonel\\r\\nWilliam R. “Rip” Collins. It would be the largest concentration of\\r\\nMarine tanks in the war, virtually an armored regiment. The attack plan\\r\\nseemed solid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marines soon realized they were now trying to force passage\\r\\nthrough Kuribayashi’s main defensive belt. The well-coordinated attack\\r\\ndegenerated into desperate, small-unit actions all along the front. The\\r\\n26th Marines on the left, aided by the tanks, gained the most yardage,\\r\\nbut it was all relative. The airfield runways proved to be lethal\\r\\nkilling zones. Marine tanks were bedeviled by mines and high-velocity\\r\\ndirect fire weapons all along the front. On the right flank, Lieutenant\\r\\nColonel Alexander A. Vandegrift, Jr., son of the Commandant, became a\\r\\ncasualty. Major Doyle A. Stout took command of the 3d Battalion, 24th\\r\\nMarines.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the fighting on D+5, General Schmidt took leave of Admiral Hill\\r\\nand moved his command post ashore from the amphibious force flagship\\r\\n_Auburn_ (AGC 10). Colonel Howard N. Kenyon led his 9th Marines ashore\\r\\nand into a staging area. With that, General Erskine moved the command\\r\\npost of the 3d Marine Division ashore; the 21st Marines reverted to its\\r\\nparent command. Erskine’s artillery regiment, the 12th Marines under\\r\\nLieutenant Colonel Raymond F. Crist, Jr., continued to land for the\\r\\nnext several days. Schmidt now had eight infantry regiments committed.\\r\\nHolland Smith still retained the 3d Marines in Expeditionary Troops\\r\\nreserve. Schmidt made the first of several requests to Smith for\\r\\nrelease of this seasoned outfit. The V Amphibious Corps had already\\r\\nsuffered 6,845 casualties.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 110604\\r\\n\\r\\n_Expended shells and open ammunition boxes testify to the heavy\\r\\nsupporting fire this water-cooled, .30-caliber Browning machine gun\\r\\npoured on the enemy as Marines advanced in the furious and difficult\\r\\nbattle for the heights of Suribachi._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, D+6, 25 February, provided little relief in terms of\\r\\nJapanese resistance. Small groups of Marines, accompanied by tanks,\\r\\nsomehow made it across the runway, each man harboring the inescapable\\r\\nfeeling he was alone in the middle of a gigantic bowling alley.\\r\\nSometimes holding newly gained positions across the runway proved\\r\\nmore deadly than the process of getting there. Resupply became nearly\\r\\nimpossible. Tanks were invaluable; many were lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchmidt this day managed to get on shore the rest of his corps\\r\\nartillery, two battalions of 155mm howitzers under Colonel John\\r\\nS. Letcher. Well-directed fire from these heavier field pieces\\r\\neased some of the pressure. So did call fire from the cruisers and\\r\\ndestroyers assigned to each maneuver unit. But the Marines expressed\\r\\ndisappointment in their air support. The 3d Marine Division complained\\r\\nthat the Navy’s assignment of eight fighters and eight bombers on\\r\\nstation was “entirely inadequate.” By noon on this date General Cates\\r\\nsent a message to Schmidt requesting that “the Strategic Air Force in\\r\\nthe Marianas replace Navy air support immediately.” Colonel Vernon E.\\r\\nMegee, now ashore as Air Commander Iwo Jima and taking some of the heat\\r\\nfrom frustrated division commanders, blamed “those little spit-kit\\r\\nNavy fighters up there, trying to help, never enough, never where they\\r\\nshould be.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fairness, it is doubtful whether any service could have provided\\r\\neffective air support during the opening days of the drive north. The\\r\\nAir Liaison Parties with each regiment played hell trying to identify\\r\\nand mark targets, the Japanese maintained masterful camouflage,\\r\\nfrontline units were often “eyeball-to-eyeball” with the enemy, and\\r\\nthe air support request net was overloaded. The Navy squadrons rising\\r\\nfrom the decks of escort carriers improved thereafter, to the extent\\r\\nthat their conflicting missions would permit. Subsequent strikes\\r\\nfeatured heavier bombs (up to five hundred pounds) and improved\\r\\nresponse time. A week later General Cates rated his air support\\r\\n“entirely satisfactory.” The battle of Iwo Jima, however, would\\r\\ncontinue to frustrate all providers of supporting arms; the Japanese\\r\\nalmost never assembled legitimate targets in the open.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Japs weren’t _on_ Iwo Jima,” said Captain Fields of the 26th\\r\\nMarines, “they were _in_ Iwo Jima.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Wheeler, who survived service with the 28th Marines and\\r\\nlater wrote two engrossing books about the battle, pointed out this\\r\\nphenomenon:\\r\\n\\r\\n  This was surely one of the strangest battlefields in history, with\\r\\n  one side fighting wholly above the ground and the other operating\\r\\n  almost wholly within it. Throughout the battle, American aerial\\r\\n  observers marveled at the fact that one side of the field held\\r\\n  thousands of figures, either milling around or in foxholes, while\\r\\n  the other side seemed deserted. The strangest thing of all was that\\r\\n  the two contestants sometimes made troop movements simultaneously\\r\\n  in the same territory, one maneuvering on the surface and the other\\r\\n  using tunnels beneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Marines struggled to wrest the second airfield from the\\r\\nJapanese, the commanding terrain features rising to the north caught\\r\\ntheir attention. Some would become known by their elevations (although\\r\\nthere were _three_ Hill 362s on the island), but others would take\\r\\nthe personality and nicknames assigned by the attackers. Hence,\\r\\nthe 4th Marine Division would spend itself attacking Hill 382, the\\r\\n“Amphitheater,” and “Turkey Knob” (the whole bristling complex became\\r\\nknown as “The Meatgrinder”). The 5th Division would earn its spurs and\\r\\nlose most of its invaluable cadre of veteran leaders attacking Nishi\\r\\nRidge and Hills 362-A and 362-B, then end the fighting in “The Gorge.”\\r\\nThe 3d Division would focus first on Hills Peter and 199-Oboe, just\\r\\nnorth of the second airfield, then the heavily fortified Hill 362-C\\r\\nbeyond the third airstrip, and finally the moonscape jungle of stone\\r\\nwhich would become known as “Cushman’s Pocket.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Colonel Robert E. Cushman, Jr., a future Commandant,\\r\\ncommanded the 2d Battalion, 9th Marines at Iwo Jima. Cushman and his\\r\\nmen were veterans of heavy fighting in Guam, yet they were appalled\\r\\nby their first sight of the battlefield. Wrecked and burning Sherman\\r\\ntanks dotted the airstrips, a stream of casualties flowed to the rear,\\r\\n“the machine-gun fire was terrific.” Cushman mounted his troops on the\\r\\nsurviving tanks and roared across the field. There they met the same\\r\\nreverse-slope defenses which had plagued the 21st Marines. Securing\\r\\nthe adjoining two small hills--Peter and 199-Oboe--took the 3d Marine\\r\\nDivision three more days of intensely bitter fighting.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Schmidt, considering the 3d Division attack in the center\\r\\nto be his main effort, provided priority fire support from Corps\\r\\nartillery, and directed the other two divisions to allocate half their\\r\\nown regimental fire support to the center. None of the commanders was\\r\\nhappy with this. Neither the 4th Division, taking heavy casualties\\r\\nin The Amphitheater as it approached Hill 382, nor the 5th Division,\\r\\nstruggling to seize Nishi Ridge, wanted to dilute their organic fire\\r\\nsupport. Nor was General Erskine pleased with the results. The main\\r\\neffort, he argued, should clearly receive the main fire. Schmidt never\\r\\ndid solve this problem. His Corps artillery was too light; he needed\\r\\ntwice as many battalions and bigger guns--up to 8-inch howitzers, which\\r\\nthe Marine Corps had not yet fielded. He had plenty of naval gunfire\\r\\nsupport available and used it abundantly, but unless the targets lay\\r\\nin ravines facing to the sea he lost the advantage of direct, observed\\r\\nfire.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _“The Grenade,” an acrylic painting on canvas by Col\\r\\nCharles H. Waterhouse._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Marine Corps Combat Art Collection\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nSchmidt’s problems of fire support distribution received some\\r\\nalleviation on 26 February when two Marine observation planes flew\\r\\nin from the escort carrier _Wake Island_, the first aircraft to land\\r\\non Iwo’s recaptured and still fire-swept main airstrip. These were\\r\\nStinson OY single-engine observation planes, nicknamed “Grasshoppers,”\\r\\nof Lieutenant Tom Rozga’s Marine Observation Squadron (VMO) 4, and\\r\\nthey were followed the next day by similar planes from Lieutenant\\r\\nRoy G. Miller’s VMO-5. The intrepid pilots of these frail craft had\\r\\nalready had an adventurous time in the waters off Iwo Jima. Several\\r\\nhad been launched precariously from the experimental Brodie catapult\\r\\non _LST 776_, “like a peanut from a slingshot.” All 14 of the planes\\r\\nof these two observation squadrons would receive heavy Japanese fire\\r\\nin battle, not only while airborne but also while being serviced on\\r\\nthe airstrips as well. Yet these two squadrons (and elements of VMO-1)\\r\\nwould fly nearly 600 missions in support of all three divisions. Few\\r\\nunits contributed so much to the eventual suppression of Kuribayashi’s\\r\\ndeadly artillery fire. In time the mere presence of these small planes\\r\\noverhead would influence Japanese gunners to cease fire and button\\r\\nup against the inevitable counterbattery fire to follow. Often the\\r\\npilots would undertake pre-dawn or dusk missions simply to extend this\\r\\nprotective “umbrella” over the troops, risky flying given Iwo’s unlit\\r\\nfields and constant enemy sniping from the adjacent hills.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 110922\\r\\n\\r\\n_A Marine dashes past a fallen Japanese killed a short time earlier,\\r\\nall the while himself a target of searching enemy fire, during heavy\\r\\nfighting in the north._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 4th Marine Division finally seized Hill 382, the highest point\\r\\nnorth of Suribachi, but continued to take heavy casualties moving\\r\\nthrough The Amphitheater against Turkey Knob. The 5th Division overran\\r\\nNishi Ridge, then bloodied itself against Hill 362-A’s intricate\\r\\ndefenses. Said Colonel Thomas A. Wornham, commanding the 27th Marines,\\r\\nof these defenses: “They had interlocking bands of fire the likes of\\r\\nwhich you never saw.” General Cates redeployed the 28th Marines into\\r\\nthis slugfest. On 2 March a Japanese gunner fired a high-velocity shell\\r\\nwhich killed Lieutenant Colonel Chandler Johnson immediately, one week\\r\\nafter his glorious seizure of Suribachi’s summit. The 28th Marines\\r\\ncaptured Hill 362-A at the cost of 200 casualties.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the same day Lieutenant Colonel Lowell E. English, commanding the\\r\\n2d Battalion, 21st Marines, went down with a bullet through his knee.\\r\\nEnglish was bitter. His battalion was being rotated to the rear. “We\\r\\nhad taken very heavy casualties and were pretty well disorganized. I\\r\\nhad less than 300 men left out of the 1200 I came ashore with.” English\\r\\nthen received orders to turn his men around and plug a gap in the front\\r\\nlines. “It was an impossible order. I couldn’t move that disorganized\\r\\nbattalion a mile back north in 30 minutes.” General Erskine did not\\r\\nwant excuses. “You tell that damned English he’d better be there,” he\\r\\ntold the regimental commander. English fired back, “You tell that son\\r\\nof a bitch I will be there, and I was, but my men were still half a\\r\\nmile behind me and I got a blast through the knee.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the left flank, the 26th Marines mounted its most successful, and\\r\\nbloodiest, attack of the battle, finally seizing Hill 362-B. The\\r\\nday-long struggle cost 500 Marine casualties and produced five Medals\\r\\nof Honor. For Captain Frank C. Caldwell, commanding Company F, 1st\\r\\nBattalion, 26th Marines, it was the worst single day of the battle. His\\r\\ncompany suffered 47 casualties in taking the hill, including the first\\r\\nsergeant and the last of the original platoon commanders.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the first nine days of the V Amphibious Corps drive north had\\r\\nproduced a net gain of about 4,000 yards at the staggering cost of\\r\\n7,000 American casualties. Several of the pitched battles--Airfield\\r\\nNo. 2, Hill 382, Hill 362-B, for example--would of themselves warrant\\r\\na separate commemorative monograph. The fighting in each case was as\\r\\nsavage and bloody as any in Marine Corps history.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _“Fire in the Hole,” an acrylic painting on untempered\\r\\nmasonite by Col Charles H. Waterhouse, reflects the extensive use of\\r\\nTNT to blast Japanese caves._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Marine Corps Combat Art Collection\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the general situation previously described at the unsuspected\\r\\n“turning point” on 4 March (D+13) when, despite sustaining frightful\\r\\nlosses, the Marines had chewed through a substantial chunk of\\r\\nKuribayashi’s main defenses, forcing the enemy commander to shift his\\r\\ncommand post to a northern cave. This was the afternoon the first\\r\\ncrippled B-29 landed. In terms of American morale, it could not have\\r\\ncome at a better time. General Schmidt ordered a general standdown on\\r\\n5 March to enable the exhausted assault forces a brief respite and the\\r\\nopportunity to absorb some replacements.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 111933\\r\\n\\r\\n_The 3d Battalion, 28th Marines, finds the terrain on Iwo Jima more\\r\\nbroken and forbidding than the black sands of the beaches as they\\r\\nadvance in a frontal attack northward against unremitting fire from\\r\\ndetermined Japanese troops._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue of replacement troops during the battle remains controversial\\r\\neven half a century later. General Schmidt, now faced with losses\\r\\napproaching the equivalent of one entire division, again urged General\\r\\nSmith to release the 3d Marines. While each division had been assigned\\r\\na replacement draft of several thousand Marines, Schmidt wanted the\\r\\ncohesion and combat experience of Colonel James M. Stuart’s regimental\\r\\ncombat team. Holland Smith believed that the replacement drafts would\\r\\nsuffice, presuming that each man in these hybrid units had received\\r\\nsufficient infantry training to enable his immediate assignment to\\r\\nfront-line outfits. The problem lay in distributing the replacements in\\r\\nsmall, arbitrary numbers--not as teamed units--to fill the gaping holes\\r\\nin the assault battalions. The new men, expected to replace invaluable\\r\\nveterans of the Pacific War, were not only new to combat, but they\\r\\nalso were new to each other, an assortment of strangers lacking the\\r\\nlife-saving bonds of unit integrity. “They get killed the day they\\r\\ngo into battle,” said one division personnel officer in frustration.\\r\\nReplacement losses within the first 48 hours of combat were, in fact,\\r\\nappalling. Those who survived, who learned the ropes and established a\\r\\nbond with the veterans, contributed significantly to the winning of the\\r\\nbattle. The division commanders, however, decried the wastefulness of\\r\\nthis policy and urged unit replacements by the veteran battalions of\\r\\nthe 3d Marines. As General Erskine recalled:\\r\\n\\r\\n  I asked the question of Kelly Turner and Holland Smith and the\\r\\n  usual answer was, “You got enough Marines on the island now; there\\r\\n  are too damn many here.” I said, “The solution is very easy. Some\\r\\n  of these people are very tired and worn out, so take them out and\\r\\n  bring in the 3d Marines.” And they practically said, “You keep\\r\\n  quiet--we’ve made the decision.” And that was that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost surviving senior officers agreed that the decision not to use the\\r\\n3d Marines at Iwo Jima was ill-advised and costly. But Holland Smith\\r\\nnever wavered: “Sufficient troops were on Iwo Jima for the capture\\r\\nof the island ... two regiments were sufficient to cover the front\\r\\nassigned to General Erskine.” On 5 March, D+14, Smith ordered the 3d\\r\\nMarines to sail back to Guam.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Marine Corps Historical Collection\\r\\n\\r\\n_“Turkey Knob,” the outcropping which anchored the positions of the\\r\\nJapanese_ 2d Mixed Brigade _against the advance of the 4th Marine\\r\\nDivision for many days, was sketched by Cpl Daniel L.

As one example, the day after the 3d Marines, many of whose\\r\\nmembers were veterans of Bougainville and Guam, departed the amphibious\\r\\nobjective area, Company E, 2d Battalion, 23d Marines, suffered the loss\\r\\nof its seventh company commander since the battle began. Likewise,\\r\\nLieutenant Colonel Cushman’s experiences with the 2d Battalion, 9th\\r\\nMarines, seemed typical:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The casualties were fierce. By the time Iwo Jima was over I had\\r\\n  gone through two complete sets of platoon leaders, lieutenants.\\r\\n  After that we had such things as artillery forward observers\\r\\n  commanding companies and sergeants leading the platoons, which were\\r\\n  less than half-strength. It was that bad.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 110626\\r\\n\\r\\n_A light machine gun crew of Company H, 2d Battalion, 27th Marines,\\r\\nhugs the ground and takes advantage of whatever cover it can from an\\r\\nenemy gunner._]\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Colonel English recalled that by the 12th day the 2d\\r\\nBattalion, 21st Marines, had “lost every company commander.... I had\\r\\none company exec left.” Lieutenant Colonel Donn Robertson, commanding\\r\\nthe 3d Battalion, 27th Marines, lost all three of his rifle company\\r\\ncommanders, “two killed by the same damned shell.” In many infantry\\r\\nunits, platoons ceased to exist; depleted companies were merged to form\\r\\none half-strength outfit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidebar (page 29): The Japanese 320mm Spigot Mortar\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the unique Japanese weapons that Marines encountered on Iwo Jima\\r\\nwas the 320mm spigot mortar. These enormous defensive weapons were\\r\\nemplaced and operated by the Japanese Army’s _20th Independent Mortar\\r\\nBattalion_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mortar tube, which had a small cavity at the muzzle, rested on a\\r\\nsteel baseplate which, in turn, was supported by a wooden platform.\\r\\nUnlike a conventional mortar, the five-foot long projectile was placed\\r\\nover the tube instead of being dropped down the barrel. The mortar\\r\\nshell had a diameter of nearly 13 inches, while the mortar tube was\\r\\nlittle more than 10 inches wide. The weapon could hurl a 675-pound\\r\\nshell a maximum of 1,440 yards. The range was adjusted by varying the\\r\\npowder charge, while changes in deflection were accomplished by brute\\r\\nforce: shoving and pushing the base platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the tubes only held out for five or six rounds, enough shells\\r\\nwere lobbed onto Marine positions to make a lasting impression on those\\r\\nwho suffered through that campaign. According to a platoon leader who\\r\\nserved with the 28th Marines, the spigot mortar (referred to as “the\\r\\nscreaming Jesus” in his unit) was always afforded a healthy respect\\r\\nand, along with the eight-inch Japanese naval rocket, remains one of\\r\\nhis most vivid memories of Iwo Jima. General Robert E. Cushman, Jr.,\\r\\nwho commanded the 2d Battalion, 9th Marines, at Iwo Jima and went on\\r\\nto become the 25th Commandant of the Marine Corps, recalled that the\\r\\ntumbling projectile’s inaccuracy made it that much more terrifying.\\r\\n“You could see it coming,” he said, “but you never knew where the hell\\r\\nit was going to come down.”\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Kenneth L.

As assault troops neared the beach\\r\\nin their tracked amphibian vehicles, dozens of Marine Vought F4U\\r\\nCorsairs swept low over the objective, paving the way with rockets\\r\\nand machine-gun fire. “It was magnificent!” exclaimed one observer.\\r\\nUnfortunately, the eight Marine fighter squadrons present at Iwo\\r\\nthat morning came from the fast carriers of Task Force 58, not the\\r\\namphibious task force; three days later TF 58 left for good in pursuit\\r\\nof more strategic targets. Thereafter, Navy and Army Air Force pilots\\r\\nprovided yeoman service in support of the troops fighting ashore.\\r\\nSustained close air support of amphibious forces by Marine air was once\\r\\nagain postponed to some future combat proving ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Marine aviation units contributed significantly to the successful\\r\\nseizure of Iwo Jima. One of the first to see action was Marine Bombing\\r\\nSquadron (VMB) 612, based on Saipan, whose flight crews flew North\\r\\nAmerican PBJ Mitchell medium bombers in nightly, long-range rocket\\r\\nattacks against Japanese ships trying to resupply Iwo Jima from other\\r\\nbases in the Volcano and Bonin Islands. These nightly raids, combined\\r\\nwith U.S. Navy submarine interdictions, significantly reduced the\\r\\namount of ammunition and fortification material (notably barbed wire)\\r\\ndelivered to Iwo Jima’s defenders before the invasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Marine LtCol Donald K. Yost in his F4U Corsair takes\\r\\noff from the flight deck of the_ Cape Gloucester _(CVE 109) to provide\\r\\nclose air support to the fighting troops ashore.

Flying in to Iwo initially from escort carriers, or launched\\r\\nprecariously by the infamous “Brodie Slingshot” from _LST 776_, or\\r\\neventually taking off from the captured airstrips, these intrepid crews\\r\\nwere quite successful in spotting enemy artillery and mortar positions,\\r\\nand reporting them to the Supporting Arms Control Center. When Japanese\\r\\nantiaircraft gunners managed to down one of the “Grasshoppers,” Marines\\r\\nfrom all points of the island mourned.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarine transport aircraft from Marine Transport Squadrons (VMR) 952,\\r\\n253, and 353 based in the Marianas delivered critical combat cargo to\\r\\nthe island during the height of the battle. The Marines frequently\\r\\nrelied on aerial delivery before the landing force could establish a\\r\\nfully functional beachhead. On D+10, for example, VMR-952 air-dropped\\r\\ncritically needed mortar shells, machine gun parts, and blood within\\r\\nMarine lines. On 3 March, Lieutenant Colonel Malcolm S. Mackay, CO of\\r\\nVMR-952, brought in the first Marine transport to land on the island,\\r\\na Curtiss Commando R5C loaded with ammunition. All three squadrons\\r\\nfollowed suit, bringing supplies in, taking wounded men out.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 March, Marine Torpedo Bomber Squadron (VMTB) 242 flew in to\\r\\nIwo Jima from Tinian to assume responsibility for day and night\\r\\nanti-submarine patrols from the departing escort carrier force.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Vernon E. Megee, USMC, had the distinction of commanding the\\r\\nfirst Landing Force Air Support Control Unit, a milestone in the\\r\\nevolution of amphibious command and control of supporting arms. Megee\\r\\ncame ashore on D+5 with General Schmidt, but the offloading process was\\r\\nstill in such disarray that he could not assemble his communications\\r\\njeeps for another five days. This did little to deter Megee. Using\\r\\n“borrowed” gear, he quickly moved inland, coordinating the efforts of\\r\\nthe Air Liaison Parties, encouraging the Navy pilots to use bigger\\r\\nbombs and listening to the complaints of the assault commanders.\\r\\nMegee’s subsequent work in training and employing Army P-51 Mustang\\r\\npilots in direct support was masterful.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the battle’s end, General Kuribayashi transmitted to Tokyo 19\\r\\n“lessons learned” about the problems of defending against an American\\r\\namphibious assault. One of these axioms said: “The enemy’s air control\\r\\nis very strong; at least thirty aircraft are flying ceaselessly from\\r\\nearly morning to night above this very small island.”\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Bitter End_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American drive north continued after the 5 March standdown, but the\\r\\ngoing never got any easier. The nature of enemy fire changed--fewer big\\r\\nguns and rockets, less observed fire from the highlands--but now the\\r\\nterrain grew uglier, deteriorating into narrow, twisted gorges wreathed\\r\\nin sulfur mists, lethal killing zones. Marine casualties continued to\\r\\nmount, but gunshot wounds began to outnumber high-explosive shrapnel\\r\\nhits. The persistent myth among some Marine units that Japanese troops\\r\\nwere all near-sighted and hence poor marksmen ended for good at Iwo\\r\\nJima. In the close-quarters fighting among the badlands of northern\\r\\nIwo Jima, Japanese riflemen dropped hundreds of advancing Marines with\\r\\nwell-aimed shots to the head or chest. “Poor marksmen?” snorted Captain\\r\\nCaldwell of Company F, 1st Battalion, 26th Marines, “The Japs we faced\\r\\nall fired ‘Expert.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Mopping up the caves with grenades and Browning\\r\\nautomatic rifles, Marines flush out remaining Japanese hidden in Iwo\\r\\nJima’s numerous and interconnecting caves._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 142472\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nSupporting arms coordination grew more effective during the battle.\\r\\nColonel “Buzz” Letcher established what some have identified as the\\r\\nfirst corps-level Supporting Arms Coordination Center (SACC), in which\\r\\nsenior representatives of artillery, naval gunfire, and air support\\r\\npooled their talents and resources. While Letcher lacked the manpower\\r\\nand communications equipment to serve as corps artillery officer and\\r\\nsimultaneously run a full-time SACC, his efforts represented a major\\r\\nadvancement in this difficult art. So did Colonel Vernon Megee’s\\r\\nLanding Force Air Support Control Unit, which worked in relative\\r\\nharmony with the fledgling SACC. Instances of friendly fire still\\r\\noccurred, perhaps inevitably on that crowded island, but positive\\r\\ncontrol at the highest level did much to reduce the frequency of such\\r\\naccidents. In terms of response time, multiple-source coordination\\r\\nprobably worked better at the division level and below. Most infantry\\r\\nbattalions, for example, had nothing but praise for the Air Liaison\\r\\nParties, Shore Fire Control Parties, and artillery forward observer\\r\\nteams which deployed with each maneuver unit.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Marine Corps Combat Art Collection\\r\\n\\r\\n_“The Target,” by Col Charles H. Waterhouse._]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Marines remained angry at the paucity of the overall\\r\\npreliminary naval bombardment of Iwo Jima, all hands valued the\\r\\ncontinuous and responsive support received from D-day onward. Many\\r\\nof the gunfire ships stood in close--frequently less than a mile\\r\\noffshore--to deliver along the flanks and front lines, and many took\\r\\nhits from masked Japanese coast defense batteries. There were literally\\r\\nno safe zones in or around the island. Two aspects of naval gunfire at\\r\\nIwo Jima rate special mention. One was the extent to which the ships\\r\\nprovided illumination rounds over the battlefield, especially during\\r\\nthe early days before landing force artillery could assume the bulk of\\r\\nthese missions. The second unique aspect was the degree of assistance\\r\\nprovided by the smallest gunships, frequently modified landing craft\\r\\narmed with 4.2-inch mortars, rockets, or 20mm guns. These “small boys”\\r\\nproved invaluable, especially along the northwest coast where they\\r\\nfrequently worked in lock-step with the 5th Marine Division as it\\r\\napproached The Gorge.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Marines comprised the bulk of the landing force at Iwo Jima,\\r\\nthey received early and increasing support from elements of the U.S.\\r\\nArmy. Two of the four DUKW companies employed on D-day were Army units.\\r\\nThe 138th Antiaircraft Artillery Group provided 90mm AA batteries\\r\\naround the newly captured airfields. Major General James E. Chaney,\\r\\nUSA, who would become Island Commander, Iwo Jima, at the battle’s end,\\r\\nlanded on D+8 with advance elements of the 145th Infantry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as the Marines on the ground were concerned, the most welcome\\r\\nArmy units flew into Iwo Jima on 6 March (D+15). This was the 15th\\r\\nFighter Group, the vanguard of VII Fighter Command destined to\\r\\naccompany the B-29s over Tokyo. The group included the 47th Fighter\\r\\nSquadron, a seasoned outfit of North American P-51 Mustangs. Although\\r\\nthe Army pilots had no experience in direct air support of ground\\r\\ntroops, Colonel Megee liked their “eager-beaver attitude” and\\r\\nwillingness to learn. He also appreciated the fact that the Mustangs\\r\\ncould deliver 1,000-pound bombs. Megee quickly trained the Army pilots\\r\\nin striking designated targets on nearby islands in response to a\\r\\nsurface-based controller. In three days they were ready for Iwo Jima.\\r\\nMegee instructed the P-51 pilots to arm their bombs with 12-second\\r\\ndelay fuzes, attack parallel to the front lines, and approach from a\\r\\n45-degree angle. Sometimes these tactics produced spectacular results,\\r\\nespecially along the west coast, where the big bombs with delayed fuzes\\r\\nblew the sides of entire cliffs into the ocean, exposing enemy caves\\r\\nand tunnels to direct fire from the sea. “The Air Force boys did a\\r\\nlot of good,” said Megee. With that, the escort carriers departed the\\r\\narea and left close air support to the 47th Fighter Squadron for the\\r\\nduration of the battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile technically not a “supporting arm,” the field medical support\\r\\nprovided the assault Marines primarily by the Navy was a major\\r\\ncontributor to victory in the prolonged battle. The practice of\\r\\nintegrating surgeons, chaplains, and corpsmen within the Fleet Marine\\r\\nForce units continued to pay valuable dividends. In many cases company\\r\\ncorpsmen were just as tough and combat-savvy as the Marines they\\r\\naccompanied. In all cases, a wounded Marine immediately knew “his”\\r\\ncorpsman would move heaven and earth to reach him, bind his wounds, and\\r\\nstart the long process of evacuation. Most Marines at Iwo Jima would\\r\\necho the sentiments of Staff Sergeant Alfred I. Thomas, a half-track\\r\\nplatoon commander in the 25th Marines: “We had outstanding corpsmen;\\r\\nthey were just like family.”\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, the luxury of having first-rate medical assistance so\\r\\nclose to the front lines took a terrible toll. Twenty-three doctors and\\r\\n827 corpsmen were killed or wounded at Iwo Jima, a casualty rate twice\\r\\nas high as bloody Saipan.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 110902\\r\\n\\r\\n_Navy corpsmen tend a Marine who was shot in the back by enemy sniper\\r\\nfire._]\\r\\n\\r\\nRarely had combat medical support been so thoughtfully prepared and\\r\\nprovided as at Iwo Jima. Beyond the crude aid stations, further toward\\r\\nthe rear, Navy and Army field hospitals arose. Some Marines would be\\r\\nwounded, receive treatment in a field hospital tent, recuperate in a\\r\\nbunker, and return to the lines--often to receive a second or third\\r\\nwound. The more seriously wounded would be evacuated off the island,\\r\\neither by direct air to Guam, or via one of several fully staffed\\r\\nhospital ships which operated around the clock within the amphibious\\r\\nobjective area. Within the first month of the fighting on Iwo Jima,\\r\\n13,737 wounded Marines and corpsmen were evacuated by hospital ship,\\r\\nanother 2,449 by airlift.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Installed in an abandoned Japanese dugout several\\r\\nthousand yards behind the fighting, 4th Marine Division surgeons\\r\\noperated on those badly wounded Marines and Navy corpsmen who might not\\r\\nhave survived a trip to the hospital ship._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 111506\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a wounded Marine, the hazardous period came during the first few\\r\\nminutes after he went down. Japanese snipers had no compunctions about\\r\\npicking off litter crews, or corpsmen, or sometimes the wounded man\\r\\nhimself as his buddies tried to slide him clear of the fire. One of\\r\\nthe most celebrated examples of casualty evacuation occurred after a\\r\\nJapanese sniper shot Corporal Edwin J. Canter, a rocket truck crew\\r\\nchief in the 4th Marine Division, through the abdomen. The rocket\\r\\ntrucks always drew an angry fusillade of counterbattery fire from the\\r\\nJapanese, and Canter’s friends knew they had to get him away from the\\r\\nlaunch site fast. As a nearby motion picture crew recorded the drama,\\r\\nfour Marines hustling Canter down a muddy hillside heard the scream of\\r\\nan incoming shell, dumped the wounded man unceremoniously and scattered\\r\\nfor cover. The explosion killed the film crew and wounded each of the\\r\\nMarines, including Canter, again. The film footage survived, appeared\\r\\nin stateside newsreels--and eventually became part of the movie “Sands\\r\\nof Iwo Jima.” Canter was evacuated to a hospital ship, thence to\\r\\nhospitals in Guam, Hawaii, and the States. His war had ended.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 110852\\r\\n\\r\\n_As the fighting moved inland, the beaches of Iwo Jima became very busy\\r\\nplaces with the continual incoming flow of supplies. Note the many\\r\\nroads leading off the beaches over which trucks, LVTs, and DUKWs headed\\r\\nto the front lines._]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the beachmasters and shore party personnel performed\\r\\nspectacular feats to keep the advancing divisions fully armed and\\r\\nequipped. It is difficult to imagine the scope of logistical management\\r\\nand sheer, back-breaking work required to maintain such a high volume\\r\\nof supplies and equipment moving over such precarious beaches. A single\\r\\nbeach on the west coast became functional on D+11, but by that time the\\r\\nbulk of landing force supplies were on shore. General unloading ended\\r\\nthe next day, releasing the vulnerable amphibious ships from their\\r\\ntether to the beachhead. Thereafter, ammunition resupply became the\\r\\ncritical factor. On one occasion, well-aimed Japanese fire detonated\\r\\nthe entire 5th Marine Division ammo dump. In another tense moment, the\\r\\nammunition ship _Columbia Victory_ came under direct Japanese fire as\\r\\nshe approached the western beaches to commence unloading. Watching\\r\\nMarines held their breath as the ship became bracketed by fire. The\\r\\nship escaped, but the potential still existed for a disaster of\\r\\ncatastrophic proportions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2d Separate Engineer Battalion and the 62d Naval Construction\\r\\nBattalion (Seabees) repaired and extended the captured runways. In\\r\\nshort order, an entire Seabee brigade moved ashore. Marines returning\\r\\nto the beaches from the northern highlands could hardly recognize the\\r\\nplace they had first seen on D-day. There were now more than 80,000\\r\\nAmericans on the small island. Seabees had bulldozed a two-lane road up\\r\\nto the top of Suribachi.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunications, often maligned in earlier amphibious assaults, were\\r\\nnever better than at Iwo Jima. Radios and handsets were now waterproof,\\r\\nmore frequencies were available, and a variety of radio systems served\\r\\nthe varying needs of the landing force. Forward observer teams, for\\r\\nexample, used the back-pack SCR-610, while companies and platoons\\r\\nfavored the SCR-300 “walkie-talkies,” or the even lighter SCR-536\\r\\n“Spam Can” portables. Said Lieutenant Colonel James P. Berkeley,\\r\\nexecutive officer of the 27th Marines and a former communications\\r\\nofficer, “At Iwo we had near-perfect communications, all any commander\\r\\ncould ask for.” As the battle progressed, the Marines began stringing\\r\\ntelephone lines between support units and forward command posts, wisely\\r\\nelevating the wire along upright posts to avoid damage by tracked\\r\\nvehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese counterintelligence teams expected to have a field day\\r\\nsplicing into the proliferation of U.S. telephone lines, but the\\r\\nMarines baffled them by heavy use of Navajo code talkers. Each division\\r\\nemployed about two dozen trained Navajos. The 5th Marine Division\\r\\ncommand post established six Navajo networks upon arrival on the\\r\\nisland. No one, throughout the war, insofar as anyone knew, was ever\\r\\nable to translate the Navajo code talkers’ voice transmissions.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _“Iwo Jima,” proof lithograph of two Navajo code\\r\\ntalkers, by Sgt John Fabion._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Marine Corps Combat Art Collection\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican-American troops played a significant role in the capture of Iwo\\r\\nJima. Negro drivers served in the Army DUKW units active throughout\\r\\nthe landing. Black Marines of the 8th Ammunition Company and the 36th\\r\\nDepot Company landed on D-day, served as stevedores on those chaotic\\r\\nbeaches, and were joined by the 33d and 34th Depot Companies on\\r\\nD+3. These Marines were incorporated into the VAC Shore Party which\\r\\ndid Herculean work sustaining the momentum of the American drive\\r\\nnorthwards. When Japanese counterattacks penetrated to the beach areas,\\r\\nthese Marines dropped their cargo, unslung their carbines, and engaged\\r\\nin well-disciplined fire and maneuver, inflicting more casualties than\\r\\nthey sustained. Two Marines, Privates James W. Whitlock and James\\r\\nDavis, received the Bronze Star. Said Colonel Leland S. Swindler,\\r\\ncommanding the VAC Shore Party, the entire body of black Marines\\r\\n“conducted themselves with marked coolness and courage.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNews media coverage of the Iwo Jima battle was extensive and largely\\r\\nunfettered. Typical of the scores of combat correspondents who stuck\\r\\nwith the landing force throughout the battle was Marine Technical\\r\\nSergeant Frederick K. “Dick” Dashiell, a former Associated Press\\r\\nwriter assigned to the 3d Marine Division. Although downright scared\\r\\nsometimes, and filled with horror often, Dashiell stood the test, for\\r\\nhe wrote 81 front-line communiques, pounding out news releases on his\\r\\nportable typewriter on the edge of his foxhole. Dashiell’s eye for\\r\\ndetail caught the flavor of the prolonged assault. “All is bitter,\\r\\nfrontal assault, always uphill,” he wrote. He described how the\\r\\nceaseless wind filled the air with fine volcanic grit, and how often\\r\\nthe Marines had to stop and clean the grit from their weapons--and how\\r\\nnaked that made any Marine feel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Marines were exhausted at this point in the battle. Occasional\\r\\nhot food delivered close behind the front lines, or more frequently\\r\\nfresh fruit and milk from the nearby ships, helped morale some. So\\r\\ndid watching more and more crippled B-29s soar in for emergency\\r\\nlandings, often two or three a day. “It felt good to see them land,”\\r\\nsaid Sergeant James “Doc” Lindsey, a squad leader in Company G, 2d\\r\\nBattalion, 25th Marines. “You knew they’d just come from Tokyo.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 142845\\r\\n\\r\\n_From the viewpoint of Marine company commanders, having their own\\r\\n“artillery,” in the form of 60mm mortars, was a very satisfying matter.\\r\\nA 60mm mortar crew is at work, in a natural depression, lobbing round\\r\\nafter round at enemy positions._]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Erskine came down with pneumonia during this period, but\\r\\nrefused to be evacuated. Colonel Robert E. Hogaboom, his chief of\\r\\nstaff, quietly kept the war moving. The division continued to advance.\\r\\nWhen Erskine recovered, Hogaboom adjusted accordingly; the two were a\\r\\nhighly effective team.\\r\\n\\r\\nErskine had long sought the opportunity to conduct a battalion-sized\\r\\nnight operation. It rankled him that throughout the war the Americans\\r\\nseemed to have conceded the night to the Japanese. When Hill 362-C\\r\\ncontinued to thwart his advance, Erskine directed a pre-dawn advance\\r\\ndevoid of the trappings of prep fires which always seemed to identify\\r\\nthe time and place of attack. The distinction of making this unusual\\r\\nassault went to Lieutenant Colonel Harold C. “Bing” Boehm, commanding\\r\\nthe 3d Battalion, 9th Marines. Unfortunately this battalion was new\\r\\nto this particular sector and received the attack order too late\\r\\nthe previous day to reconnoiter effectively. The absence of advance\\r\\norientation notwithstanding, the battalion crossed the line of\\r\\ndeparture promptly and silently at 0500 and headed for Hill 362-C. The\\r\\nunit attained total surprise along its axis of advance. Before the\\r\\nsleepy Japanese knew it, the battalion had hurried across 500 yards of\\r\\nbroken ground, sweeping by the outposts and roasting the occasional\\r\\nstrongpoint with flamethrowers. Then it was Boehm’s turn to be\\r\\nsurprised. Daylight revealed his battalion had captured the wrong hill,\\r\\nan intermediate objective. Hill 362-C still lay 250 yards distant; now\\r\\nhe was surrounded by a sea of wide-awake and furiously counterattacking\\r\\nJapanese infantry. Boehm did what seemed natural: he redeployed his\\r\\nbattalion and attacked towards the original objective. This proved\\r\\nvery rough going and took much of the day, but before dark the 3d\\r\\nBattalion, 9th Marines stood in sole possession of Hill 362-C, one of\\r\\nKuribayashi’s main defensive anchors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoehm’s success, followed shortly by General Senda’s costly\\r\\ncounterattack against the 4th Marine Division, seemed to represent\\r\\nanother turning point of the battle. On D+18 a patrol from the 3d\\r\\nMarine Division reached the northeast coast. The squad leader filled\\r\\na canteen with salt water and sent it back to General Schmidt marked\\r\\n“For inspection--not consumption.” Schmidt welcomed the symbolism.\\r\\nThe next day the 4th Marine Division finally pinched out Turkey\\r\\nKnob, moving out of The Amphitheater towards the east coast. The end\\r\\nseemed tantalizingly close, but the intensity of Japanese resistance\\r\\nhardly waned. Within the 5th Marine Division’s zone in the west, the\\r\\n2d Battalion, 26th Marines, was reporting an aggregate casualty rate\\r\\napproaching 70 percent. General Rockey warned of a state of “extreme\\r\\nexhaustion and fatigue.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe division commanders began to look elsewhere for relief of their\\r\\nshot-up battalions. In the 4th Marine Division, General Cates formed\\r\\na provisional battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Melvin L. Krulewitch\\r\\nwhich conducted a series of attacks against the many bypassed enemy\\r\\npositions. The term “mopping up” as applied to Iwo Jima, whether\\r\\nby service troops or subsequent Army garrison units, should be\\r\\nconsidered relative. Many pockets of Japanese held out indefinitely,\\r\\nwell-armed and defiant to the end. Rooting them out was never easy.\\r\\nOther divisions used cannoneers, pioneers, motor transport units,\\r\\nand amtrackers as light infantry units, either to augment front-line\\r\\nbattalions or conduct combat patrols throughout rear areas. By this\\r\\ntime, however, the extreme rear area at Iwo had become overconfident.\\r\\nMovies were being shown every night. Ice cream could be found on the\\r\\nbeach. Men swam in the surf and slept in tents. This all provided a\\r\\nfalse and deadly sense of security.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot very far to the north, Lieutenant Colonel Cushman’s 2d Battalion,\\r\\n9th Marines, became engaged in a sustained battle in extremely broken\\r\\nterrain east of the third airfield. The Marines eventually encircled\\r\\nthe Japanese positions, but the battle for “Cushman’s Pocket” raged on.\\r\\nAs the battalion commander reported the action:\\r\\n\\r\\n  The enemy position was a maze of caves, pillboxes, emplaced\\r\\n  tanks, stone walls and trenches.... We beat against this position\\r\\n  for eight continuous days, using every supporting weapon. The\\r\\n  core--main objective of the sector--still remained. The battalion\\r\\n  was exhausted. Almost all leaders were gone and the battalion\\r\\n  numbered about 400, including 350 replacements.\\r\\n\\r\\nCushman’s 2d Battalion, 9th Marines, was relieved, but other elements\\r\\nof the 9th and 21st Marines, equally exhausted, had just as difficult\\r\\na time. Erskine truly had no reserves. He called Cushman back into the\\r\\npocket. By 16 March (D+25), Japanese resistance in this thicket of\\r\\njumbled rocks ended. The 4th Marine Division, meanwhile, poured over\\r\\nthe hills along the east, seizing the coast road and blasting the last\\r\\nJapanese strongpoints from the rear. Ninety percent of Iwo Jima now lay\\r\\nin American hands. Radio Tokyo carried the mournful remarks of Prime\\r\\nMinister Kuniaki Koiso, who announced the fall of Iwo Jima as “the most\\r\\nunfortunate thing in the whole war situation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Smith took the opportunity to declare victory and conduct a\\r\\nflag-raising ceremony. With that, the old warhorse departed. Admiral\\r\\nTurner had sailed previously. Admiral Hill and General Schmidt finally\\r\\nhad the campaign to themselves. Survivors of the 4th Division began\\r\\nbackloading on board ship, their battle finally over.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Marine Corps Historical Collection\\r\\n\\r\\n_After 24 days of the most bitter battle in the history of the Marine\\r\\nCorps to that date, on 14 March 1945, the colors were raised once again\\r\\non Iwo Jima to signify the occupation of the island, although the\\r\\nbattle was still raging in the north. The official end of the campaign\\r\\nwould not be until 14 days later, on 26 March._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe killing continued in the north. The 5th Marine Division entered The\\r\\nGorge, an 800-yard pocket of incredibly broken country which the troops\\r\\nwould soon call “Death Valley.” Here General Kuribayashi maintained his\\r\\nfinal command center in a deep cave. Fighting in this ungodly landscape\\r\\nprovided a fitting end to the battle--nine endless days of cave-by-cave\\r\\nassaults with flamethrowers and demolitions. Combat engineers used\\r\\n8,500 tons of explosives to detonate one huge fortification. Progress\\r\\nwas slow and costlier than ever. General Rockey’s drained and depleted\\r\\nregiments lost one more man with every two yards gained. To ease the\\r\\npressure, General Schmidt deployed the 3d Marine Division against\\r\\nKitano Point in the 5th Division zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Hartnoll J. Withers directed the final assault of his 21st\\r\\nMarines against the extreme northern tip of the island. General\\r\\nErskine, pneumonia be damned, came forward to look over his shoulder.\\r\\nThe 21st Marines could see the end, and their momentum proved\\r\\nirresistible. In half a day of sharp fighting they cleared the point of\\r\\nthe last defenders. Erskine signalled Schmidt: “Kitano Point is taken.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth divisions made serious efforts to persuade Kuribayashi to\\r\\nsurrender during these final days, broadcasting appeals in Japanese,\\r\\nsending personal messages praising his valor and urging his\\r\\ncooperation. Kuribayashi remained a samurai to the end. He transmitted\\r\\none final message to Tokyo, saying “we have not eaten or drunk for five\\r\\ndays, but our fighting spirit is still running high. We are going to\\r\\nfight bravely to the last.” Imperial Headquarters tried to convey the\\r\\ngood news to him that the Emperor had approved his promotion to full\\r\\ngeneral. There was no response from Iwo Jima. Kuribayashi’s promotion\\r\\nwould be posthumous. Fragmentary Japanese accounts indicate he took his\\r\\nown life during the night of 25-26 March.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn The Gorge, the 5th Marine Division kept clawing forward. The\\r\\ndivision reported that the average battalion, which had landed with\\r\\n36 officers and 885 men on D-day, now mustered 16 officers and 300\\r\\nmen, including the hundreds of replacements funneled in during the\\r\\nfighting. The remnants of the 1st Battalion, 26th Marines, and the 1st\\r\\nBattalion, 28th Marines, squeezed the Japanese into a final pocket,\\r\\nthen overwhelmed them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the evening of 25 March, D+34, and the amphibious assault on\\r\\nthe rocky fortress of Iwo Jima finally appeared over. The island grew\\r\\nstrangely quiet. There were far fewer illumination shells. In the\\r\\nflickering false light, some saw shadowy figures, moving south, towards\\r\\nthe airfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Schmidt received the good news that the 5th Marine Division had\\r\\nsnuffed out the final enemy cave in The Gorge on the evening of D+34.\\r\\nBut even as the corps commander prepared his announcement declaring the\\r\\nend of organized resistance on Iwo Jima, a very well-organized enemy\\r\\nforce emerged from northern caves and infiltrated down the length of\\r\\nthe island. This final spasm of Japanese opposition still reflected\\r\\nthe influence of Kuribayashi’s tactical discipline. The 300-man force\\r\\ntook all night to move into position around the island’s now vulnerable\\r\\nrear base area, the tents occupied by freshly arrived Army pilots of\\r\\nVII Fighter Command, adjacent to Airfield No. 1. The counterattacking\\r\\nforce achieved total surprise, falling on the sleeping pilots out of\\r\\nthe darkness with swords, grenades, and automatic weapons. The fighting\\r\\nwas as vicious and bloody as any that occurred in Iwo Jima’s many\\r\\narenas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surviving pilots and members of the 5th Pioneer Battalion\\r\\nimprovised a skirmish line and launched a counterattack of their\\r\\nown. Seabees and elements of the redeploying 28th Marines joined the\\r\\nfray. There were few suicides among the Japanese; most died in place,\\r\\ngrateful to strike one final blow for the Emperor. Sunrise revealed the\\r\\nawful carnage: 300 dead Japanese; more than 100 slain pilots, Seabees,\\r\\nand pioneers; and another 200 American wounded. It was a grotesque\\r\\nclosing chapter to five continuous weeks of savagery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 5th Marine Division and the 21st Marines wasted no time in\\r\\nbackloading on board amphibious ships. The 9th Marines, last of the VAC\\r\\nmaneuver units to land, became the last to leave, conducting two more\\r\\nweeks of ambushes and combat patrols. The 147th Infantry inherited more\\r\\nof the same. In the first two months after the Marines left, the Army\\r\\ntroops killed 1,602 Japanese and captured 867 more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidebar (page 37): The Marines’ Zippo Tanks\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the Marines on the ground, the Sherman M4A3 medium tank equipped\\r\\nwith the Navy Mark I flame thrower seemed to be the most valuable\\r\\nweapon employed in the battle of Iwo Jima.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marines had come a long way in the tactical use of fire in the 15\\r\\nmonths since Tarawa, when only a handful of backpack flame throwers\\r\\nwere available to combat the island’s hundreds of fortifications. While\\r\\nthe landing force still relied on portable flame throwers, most Marines\\r\\ncould see the value of marrying the technology with armored vehicles\\r\\nfor use against the toughest targets. In the Marianas, the Marines\\r\\nmodified M3A1 light tanks with the Canadian Ronson flame system to good\\r\\neffect; the problems came from the vulnerability of the small vehicles.\\r\\nAt Peleliu, the 1st Marine Division mounted the improvised Mark I\\r\\nsystem on a thin-skinned LVT-4; again, vehicle vulnerability limited\\r\\nthe system’s effectiveness. The obvious solution seemed to be to mount\\r\\nthe flame thrower in a medium tank.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first modification to Sherman tanks involved the installation of\\r\\nthe small E4-5 mechanized flame thrower in place of the bow machine\\r\\ngun. This was only a marginal improvement; the system’s short range,\\r\\nmodest fuel supply, and awkward aiming process hardly offset the loss\\r\\nof the machine gun. Even so, each of the three tank battalions employed\\r\\nE4-5-equipped Shermans during Iwo Jima.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best solution to marrying effective flame projection with\\r\\nmechanized mobility resulted from an unlikely inter-service task force\\r\\nof Seabees, Army Chemical Warfare Service technicians, and Fleet Marine\\r\\nForce tankers in Hawaii before the invasion. According to Lieutenant\\r\\nColonel William R. Collins, commanding the 5th Tank Battalion, this\\r\\ninspired group of field-expedient tinkerers modified the Mark I flame\\r\\nthrower to operate from within the Sherman’s turret, replacing the\\r\\n75mm main gun with a look-alike launch tube. The modified system\\r\\ncould thus be trained and pointed like any conventional turret gun.\\r\\nUsing napalm-thickened fuel, the “Zippo Tanks” could spew flame up\\r\\nto 150 yards for a duration of 55-80 seconds, both quantum tactical\\r\\nimprovements.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, the _ad hoc_ modification team had only sufficient\\r\\ntime and components to modify eight M4A3 tanks with the Mark I flame\\r\\nsystem; four each went to the 4th and 5th Tank Battalions. The 3d Tank\\r\\nBattalion, then staging in Guam, received neither the M4A3 Shermans\\r\\nnor the field modifications in time for Iwo Jima, although a number of\\r\\ntheir “A2” tanks retained the E4-5 system mounted in the bow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eight modified Sherman flame tanks proved ideal against Iwo Jima’s\\r\\nrugged caves and concrete fortifications. The Japanese feared this\\r\\nweapon greatly; time and again suicide squads of “human bullets” would\\r\\nassail the flame tanks directly, only to be shot down by covering\\r\\nforces or scorched by the main weapon. Enemy fire and the rough terrain\\r\\ntook their toll on the eight flame tanks, but maintenance crews worked\\r\\naround the clock to keep them functional.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the words of Captain Frank C. Caldwell, a company commander in the\\r\\n26th Marines: “In my view it was the flame tank more than any other\\r\\nsupporting arm that won this battle.” Tactical demands for the flame\\r\\ntanks never diminished. Late in the battle, as the 5th Marine Division\\r\\ncornered the last Japanese defenders in “The Gorge,” the 5th Tank\\r\\nBattalion expended napalm-thickened fuel at the rate of 10,000 gallons\\r\\nper day. The division’s final action report stated that the flame tank\\r\\nwas “the one weapon that caused the Japs to leave their caves and rock\\r\\ncrevices and run.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _A Marine flame tank, also known as a “Ronson,” scorches\\r\\na Japanese strongpoint. The eight M4A3 Shermans equipped with the Navy\\r\\nMark I flame-thrower proved to be the most valuable weapons systems on\\r\\nIwo Jima._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 140758\\r\\n]\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidebar (page 42): Iwo’s Fire Brigades: The Rocket Detachments\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAttached to the assault divisions of the landing force at Iwo Jima\\r\\nwere provisional rocket detachments. The infantry had a love-hate\\r\\nrelationship with the forward-deploying little rocket trucks and their\\r\\nplucky crews. The “system” was an International one-ton 4×4 truck\\r\\nmodified to carry three box-shaped launchers, each containing a dozen\\r\\n4.5-inch rockets. A good crew could launch a “ripple” of 36 rockets\\r\\nwithin a matter of seconds, providing a blanket of high explosives\\r\\non the target. This the infantry loved--but each launching always\\r\\ndrew heavy return fire from the Japanese who feared the “automatic\\r\\nartillery.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marines formed an Experimental Rocket Unit in June 1943 and first\\r\\ndeployed rail-launched barrage rockets during the fighting in the\\r\\nupper Solomons. There the heavily canopied jungles limited their\\r\\neffectiveness. Once mounted on trucks and deployed to the Central\\r\\nPacific, however, the weapons proved much more useful, particularly\\r\\nduring the battle of Saipan. The Marines modified the small trucks by\\r\\nreinforcing the tail gate to serve as a blast shield, installing a\\r\\nhydraulic jack to raise and lower the launchers, and applying gravity\\r\\nquadrants and elevation safety chains. Crude steel rods welded to the\\r\\nbumper and dashboard helped the driver align the vehicle with aiming\\r\\nstakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreeless, hilly Iwo Jima proved an ideal battleground for these\\r\\nso-called “Buck Rogers Men.” At Iwo, the 1st Provisional Rocket\\r\\nDetachment supported the 4th Marine Division and the 3d Detachment\\r\\nsupported the 5th Division throughout the operation (the 3d Division\\r\\ndid not have such a unit in this battle). Between them, the two\\r\\ndetachments fired more than 30,000 rockets in support of the landing\\r\\nforce.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 3d Detachment landed over Red Beach on D-day, losing one vehicle\\r\\nto the surf, others to the loose sand or heavy enemy fire. One vehicle\\r\\nreached its firing position intact and launched a salvo of rockets\\r\\nagainst Japanese fortifications along the slopes of Suribachi,\\r\\ndetonating an enemy ammunition dump. The detachment subsequently\\r\\nsupported the 1st Battalion, 28th Marines’ advance to the summit, often\\r\\nlaunching single rockets to clear suspected enemy positions along the\\r\\nroute.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the fighting moved north, the short range, steep angle of fire, and\\r\\nsaturation effect of the rocket launchers kept them in high demand.\\r\\nThey were particularly valuable in defilade-to-defilade bombardments\\r\\nmarking the final punctuation of pre-assault prep fires. But their\\r\\ndistinctive flash and telltale blast also caught the attention of\\r\\nJapanese artillery spotters. The rocket trucks rarely remained in one\\r\\nplace long enough to fire more than two salvos. “Speedy displacement”\\r\\nwas the key to their survival. The nearby infantry knew better than to\\r\\nstand around and wave goodbye; this was the time to seek deep shelter\\r\\nfrom the counterbattery fire sure to follow.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _The positions from which rocket troops launched salvos\\r\\nof 4.5-inch rockets became very unhealthy places, indeed, as Japanese\\r\\nartillery and mortars zeroed in on the clouds of smoke and dust\\r\\nresulting from the firing of the rockets._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 111100\\r\\n]\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidebar (page 44): Amphibious Logistical Support at Iwo Jima\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe logistical effort required to sustain the seizure of Iwo Jima was\\r\\nenormous, complex, largely improvised on lessons learned in earlier\\r\\nMarine Corps operations in the Pacific, and highly successful. Clearly,\\r\\nno other element of the emerging art of amphibious warfare had improved\\r\\nso greatly by the winter of 1945. Marines may have had the heart and\\r\\nfirepower to tackle a fortress-like Iwo Jima earlier in the war, but\\r\\nthey would have been crippled in the doing of it by limitations in\\r\\namphibious logistical support capabilities. These concepts, procedures,\\r\\norganizations, and special materials took years to develop; once in\\r\\nplace they fully enabled such large-scale conquests as Iwo Jima and\\r\\nOkinawa.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Iwo Jima operation, VAC had the 8th Field Depot, commanded\\r\\nby Colonel Leland S. Swindler. The depot was designed to serve as\\r\\nthe nucleus of the shore party operation; the depot commander was\\r\\ndual-hatted as the Shore Party Commander of the Landing Force, in\\r\\nwhich capacity he was responsible for coordinating the activities of\\r\\nthe division shore parties. The timing of the logistics support at Iwo\\r\\nJima proved to be well conceived and executed. Liaison teams from the\\r\\n8th Field Depot accompanied the 4th and 5th Divisions ashore. On D+3,\\r\\nunits of the field depot came ashore, and two days after this, when VAC\\r\\nassumed control on shore, the field depot took over and the unloading\\r\\ncontinued without interruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe V Amphibious Corps at Iwo Jima used every conceivable means of\\r\\ndelivering combat cargo ashore when and where needed by the landing\\r\\nforce. These means sequentially involved the prescribed loads and\\r\\nunits of fire carried by the assault waves; “hot cargo” preloaded\\r\\nin on-call waves or floating dumps; experimental use of “one-shot”\\r\\npreloaded amphibious trailers and Wilson drums; general unloading;\\r\\nadministrative unloading of what later generations of amphibians\\r\\nwould call an “assault follow-on echelon”; and aerial delivery of\\r\\ncritically short items, first by parachute, then by transports landing\\r\\non the captured runways. In the process, the Navy-Marine Corps team\\r\\nsuccessfully experimented with the use of armored bulldozers and sleds\\r\\nloaded with hinged Marston matting delivered in the assault waves to\\r\\nhelp clear wheeled vehicles stuck in the soft volcanic sand. In spite\\r\\nof formidable early obstacles--foul weather, heavy surf, dangerous\\r\\nundertows, and fearsome enemy fire--the system worked. Combat cargo\\r\\nflowed in; casualties and salvaged equipment flowed out.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortages appeared from time to time, largely the result of the Marines\\r\\non shore meeting a stronger and larger defense garrison than estimated.\\r\\nHence, urgent calls soon came for more demolitions, grenades, mortar\\r\\nillumination rounds, flame-thrower recharging units, and whole blood.\\r\\nTransport squadrons delivered many of these critical items directly\\r\\nfrom fleet bases in the Marianas.\\r\\n\\r\\nField medical support at Iwo Jima was a model of exhaustive planning\\r\\nand flexible application. The Marines had always enjoyed the finest\\r\\nimmediate medical attention from their organic surgeons and corpsmen,\\r\\nbut the backup system ashore at Iwo Jima, from field hospitals\\r\\nto graves registration, was mind-boggling to the older veterans.\\r\\nModerately wounded Marines received full hospital treatment and\\r\\nrehabilitation; many returned directly to their units, thus preserving\\r\\nat least some of the rapidly decreasing levels of combat experience in\\r\\nfrontline outfits. The more seriously wounded were treated, stabilized,\\r\\nand evacuated, either to offshore hospital ships or by air transport to\\r\\nGuam.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marines fired an unprecedented half million artillery rounds in\\r\\ndirect and general support of the assault units. More rounds were lost\\r\\nwhen the 5th Marine Division dump blew up. The flow never stopped. The\\r\\nShore Party used DUKWs, LVTs, and larger craft for rapid offloading\\r\\nof ammunition ships dangerously exposed to Iwo Jima’s enemy gunners.\\r\\nMarine Corps ammunition and depot companies hustled the fresh munitions\\r\\nashore and into the neediest hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Colonel James D. Hittle, USMC, served as D-4 of the 3d\\r\\nMarine Division throughout the battle of Iwo Jima. While shaking his\\r\\nhead at the “crazy-quilt” logistic adaptations dictated by Iwo’s\\r\\ngeography, Hittle saw creative staff management at all levels. The 3d\\r\\nDivision, earmarked as the reserve for the landing, found it difficult\\r\\nto undertake combat loading of their ships in the absence of a scheme\\r\\nof maneuver on shore, but the staff made valid assumptions based on\\r\\ntheir earlier experiences. This paid huge dividends when the corps\\r\\ncommander had to commit the 21st Marines as a separate tactical unit\\r\\nwell in advance of the division. Thanks to foresightful combat loading,\\r\\nthe regiment landed fully equipped and supported, ready for immediate\\r\\ndeployment in the fighting.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo augment the supplies coming across the beach, the 3d Division staff\\r\\nair officer “appropriated” a transport plane and made regular runs to\\r\\nthe division’s base in Guam, bringing back fresh beef, mail, and cases\\r\\nof beer. The 3d Division G-4 also sent his transport quartermaster\\r\\n(today’s embarkation officer) out to sea with an LVT-full of war\\r\\nsouvenirs; these were bartered with ship’s crews for donations of fresh\\r\\nfruit, eggs, bread--“we’d take anything.” General Erskine distributed\\r\\nthese treats personally to the men in the lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nRetired Brigadier General Hittle marveled at the density of troops\\r\\nfunnelled into the small island. “At one point we had 60,000 men\\r\\noccupying less than three-and-a-half square miles of broken terrain.”\\r\\nThese produced startling neighbors: a 105mm battery firing from the\\r\\nmiddle of the shore party cantonment; the division command post sited\\r\\n1,000 yards from Japanese lines; “giant B-29s taking off and landing\\r\\nforward of the CP of an assault regiment.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the effort to establish a fresh-water distilling plant, Marine\\r\\nengineers dug a “well” near the beach. Instead of a source of salt\\r\\nwater the crew discovered steaming mineral water, heated by Suribachi’s\\r\\nsupposedly dormant volcano. Hittle moved the 3d Division distilling\\r\\nsite elsewhere; this spot became a hot shower facility, soon one of the\\r\\nmost popular places on the island.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 109635\\r\\n]\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Iwo Jima’s Costs, Gains, and Legacies_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its 36 days of combat on Iwo Jima, the V Amphibious Corps killed\\r\\napproximately 22,000 Japanese soldiers and sailors. The cost was\\r\\nstaggering. The assault units of the corps--Marines and organic\\r\\nNavy personnel--sustained 24,053 casualties, by far the highest\\r\\nsingle-action losses in Marine Corps history. Of these, a total of\\r\\n6,140 died. Roughly one Marine or corpsman became a casualty for every\\r\\nthree who landed on Iwo Jima.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a subsequent analysis by military historian Dr. Norman\\r\\nCooper, “Nearly seven hundred Americans gave their lives for every\\r\\nsquare mile. For every plot of ground the size of a football field, an\\r\\naverage of more than one American and five Japanese were killed and\\r\\nfive Americans wounded.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _The fighting hardly over, grizzled, begrimed, and tired\\r\\nMarines solemnly display the spoils of war captured in a very long,\\r\\ndifficult, and hard-fought battle._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Marine Corps Historical Collection\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assault infantry units bore the brunt of these losses. Captain\\r\\nWilliam T. Ketcham’s Company I, 3d Battalion, 24th Marines, landed on\\r\\nD-day with 133 Marines in the three rifle platoons. Only nine of these\\r\\nmen remained when the remnants of the company reembarked on D+35.\\r\\nCaptain Frank C. Caldwell reported the loss of 221 men from Company\\r\\nF, 1st Battalion, 26th Marines. At the end, a private first class\\r\\nserved as platoon commander for Caldwell’s merged first and second\\r\\nplatoons. Elsewhere in the 1st Battalion, 26th Marines, Captain Tom\\r\\nFields relinquished command of Company D on the eighth day to replace\\r\\nthe battalion executive officer. Rejoining his company at the end of\\r\\nthe battle, Fields was sickened to find only 17 of the original 250\\r\\nmen still in the ranks. Company B, 1st Battalion, 28th Marines, went\\r\\nthrough nine company commanders in the fighting; 12 different Marines\\r\\nserved as platoon leader of the second platoon, including two buck\\r\\nprivates. Each division, each regiment, reported similar conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the extent of the losses became known in the press, the American\\r\\npublic reacted with shock and dismay as they had 14 months earlier at\\r\\nTarawa. This time, however, the debate about the high cost of forcibly\\r\\nseizing an enemy island raged in the press while the battle was still\\r\\nbeing fought.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marine Corps released only one official communique about\\r\\nspecific battle losses during the battle, reporting casualties of\\r\\nnearly 5,000 men on 22 February. Five days later, at the insistence\\r\\nof press baron William Randolph Hearst, an early supporter of the\\r\\nMacArthur-for-President claque, the _San Francisco Examiner_ ran a\\r\\nfront page editorial bewailing the Marines’ tactics and losses. “It’s\\r\\nthe same thing that happened at Tarawa and Saipan,” the editorial\\r\\nstated, urging the elevation of General MacArthur to supreme command in\\r\\nthe Pacific, because “HE SAVES THE LIVES OF HIS OWN MEN.” With that,\\r\\n100 off-duty Marines stormed the offices of the _Examiner_ demanding\\r\\nan apology. Unfortunately, the Hearst editorial received wide play;\\r\\nmany families of Marines fighting at Iwo Jima forwarded the clippings.\\r\\nMarines received these in the mail while the fighting still continued,\\r\\nan unwelcome blow to morale.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 110599\\r\\n\\r\\n_The fighting continues and continues. For weary flamethrower operators\\r\\nPvt Richard Klatt, left, and PFC Wilfred Voegeli the campaign is just\\r\\none cave after another._]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Roosevelt, long a master of public opinion, managed to keep\\r\\nthe lid on the outcry by emphasizing the sacrifice of the troops as\\r\\nepitomized by the Joe Rosenthal photograph of the second Suribachi\\r\\nflag-raising. The photograph was already widely renowned. FDR made it\\r\\nthe official logo of the Seventh War Bond Drive and demanded the six\\r\\nflag-raisers be reassigned home to enhance popular morale. Regrettably,\\r\\nthree of the six men had already been killed in subsequent fighting in\\r\\nthe drive north on Iwo Jima.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff looked appraisingly at Iwo Jima’s losses. No\\r\\none questioned the objective; Iwo Jima was an island that categorically\\r\\nhad to be seized if the strategic bombing campaign was ever going\\r\\nto be effective. The island could therefore not be bypassed or\\r\\n“leap-frogged.” There is considerable evidence that the Joint Chiefs\\r\\nconsidered the use of poison gas during the Iwo Jima planning phase.\\r\\nNeither Japan nor the United States had signed the international\\r\\nmoratorium, there were no civilians on the island, the Americans had\\r\\nstockpiles of mustard gas shells in the Pacific theater. But President\\r\\nRoosevelt scotched these considerations quickly. America, he declared,\\r\\nwould never make first use of poison gas. In any case, the use of\\r\\npoison gas on an area as relatively small as Iwo Jima, whose prevailing\\r\\nwinds would quickly dissipate the gas fumes, became moot. This left the\\r\\nlanding force with no option but a frontal amphibious assault against\\r\\nthe most heavily fortified island America ever faced in the war.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _Uncommon valor in a peaceful setting: this 4th\\r\\nDivision Marine threatens the enemy even in death.

Symbolically, the Marines raised the flag over Mount\\r\\nSuribachi on the same day that General MacArthur entered Manila. The\\r\\nparallel capture of the Philippines and Iwo Jima, followed immediately\\r\\nby the invasion of Okinawa, accelerated the pace of the war, bringing\\r\\nit at long last to Japan’s doorstep. The three campaigns convincingly\\r\\ndemonstrated to the Japanese high command that the Americans now had\\r\\nthe capability--and the will--to overwhelm even the most stoutly\\r\\ndefended islands. Kyushu and Honshu would be next.\\r\\n\\r\\nIwo Jima in American hands produced immediate and highly visible\\r\\nbenefits to the strategic bombing campaign. Marines fighting on the\\r\\nisland were reminded of this mission time and again as crippled B-29\\r\\nSuperforts flew in from Honshu. The capture of Iwo Jima served to\\r\\nincrease the operating range, payload, and survival rate of the big\\r\\nbombers. The monthly tonnage of high explosives dropped on Imperial\\r\\nJapan by B-29s based in the Marianas increased eleven-fold in March\\r\\nalone. As early as 7 April a force of 80 P-51 Mustangs of VII Fighter\\r\\nCommand took off from Iwo Jima to escort B-29s striking the Nakajima\\r\\naircraft engine plant in Tokyo. But the Army Air Force valued Iwo Jima\\r\\nmost of all as an emergency landing field. By war’s end, a total of\\r\\n2,251 B-29s made forced landings on the island. This figure represented\\r\\n24,761 flight crewmen, many of whom would have perished at sea without\\r\\nthe availability of Iwo Jima as a safe haven. Said one B-29 pilot,\\r\\n“whenever I land on this island I thank God for the men who fought for\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Tadamichi Kuribayashi proved to be one of the most competent\\r\\nfield commanders the Marines ever faced. He displayed a masterful grasp\\r\\nof the principles of simplicity and economy of force, made maximum use\\r\\nof Iwo’s forbidding terrain, employed his artillery and mortars with\\r\\ngreat skill, and exercised command with an iron will virtually to the\\r\\nend. He was also a realist. Without hope of even temporary naval or\\r\\nair superiority he knew he was doomed from the start. In five weeks\\r\\nof unremitting pressure, the Americans breached every strongpoint,\\r\\nexterminated his forces, and seized the island.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 142434\\r\\n\\r\\n_With his buddies holding the four corners of the National Colors,\\r\\nthe last rites for a fallen Marine are offered by the chaplain at a\\r\\ntemporary gravesite in Iwo’s black sand.

The sheer\\r\\nmagnitude of the task--planning the assault and sustaining of that many\\r\\ntroops against such a formidable objective--made Operation Detachment\\r\\nan enduring model of “detailed planning and violent execution.”\\r\\nHere the element of surprise was not available to the attacker.\\r\\nYet the speed of the American landing and the toughness with which\\r\\nassault units withstood the withering barrages astounded the Japanese\\r\\ndefenders. “The landing on Iwo was the epitome of everything we’d\\r\\nlearned over the years about amphibious assaults,” said Colonel Wornham\\r\\nof the 27th Marines. Bad as the enemy fire became on D-day, there were\\r\\nno reports of “Issue in doubt.” Lieutenant Colonel Galer compared Iwo\\r\\nJima with his Guadalcanal experience: “Then it was ‘can we hold?’ Here\\r\\nat Iwo Jima the question was simply ‘When can we get it over?’”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship-to-shore assault at Iwo was impressive enough, but the real\\r\\nmeasure of amphibious effectiveness can be seen in the massive,\\r\\nsustained logistical support which somehow flowed over those\\r\\ntreacherous beaches. Not only did the Marines have all the ammunition\\r\\nand flamethrower refills they needed, around the clock, but they also\\r\\nhad many of the less obvious necessities and niceties which marked\\r\\nthis battle as different from its predecessors. Marines on Iwo had\\r\\nample quantities of whole blood, some of it donated barely two weeks in\\r\\nadvance, flown in, refrigerated, and available. The Marines also had\\r\\nmail call, unit newsletters, fresh water, radio batteries, fresh-baked\\r\\nbread, and prefabricated burial markers, thousands of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIwo Jima featured superior inter-service cooperation. The Navy-Marine\\r\\nCorps team rarely functioned more efficiently. The blue-water Navy\\r\\ncontinued to earn the respect of the Marines, especially on D-2\\r\\nwhen the flotilla of tiny LCI gunboats bravely attacked the coastal\\r\\ndefense guns to protect the Navy and Marine frogmen. Likewise, the\\r\\nMarines welcomed the contributions of the Army, Coast Guard, Coast and\\r\\nGeodetic Survey, Red Cross, and the host of combat correspondents--all\\r\\nof whom shared both the misery and the glory of the prolonged battle.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 111147\\r\\n\\r\\n_At the end of a very long fight, a Marine flamethrower operator pauses\\r\\nto light up._]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _LtGen Holland M.

After this, he returned to his headquarters on Hawaii._\\r\\n\\r\\n    Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 110635\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo aspects of the battle remain controversial: the inadequate\\r\\npreliminary bombardment and the decision to use piecemeal replacements\\r\\ninstead of organized units to strengthen the assault forces. Both\\r\\ndecisions, rendered in the context of several competing factors, were\\r\\nmade by experienced commanders in good faith. Unavoidably, Iwo Jima’s\\r\\nbiggest cost to the V Amphibious Corps was the loss of so many combat\\r\\nveterans in taking the island. While the battle served to create a\\r\\nnew generation of veterans among the survivors, many proud regiments\\r\\nsuffered devastating losses. With these same units already designated\\r\\nas key components of the landing force against the Japanese home\\r\\nislands, such losses had serious potential implications. These factors\\r\\nmay well have influenced General Holland Smith’s unpopular decision\\r\\nto withhold the 3d Marines from the battle. From the perspective of\\r\\nan exhausted company commander on Iwo Jima, Smith’s decision seemed\\r\\ninexcusable, then and now; from the wider perspective of the commanding\\r\\ngeneral, Fleet Marine Forces, Pacific, the decision makes more sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever his shortcomings, Holland Smith probably knew amphibious\\r\\nwarfare better than anyone. Of the hundreds of after-action reports\\r\\nfiled immediately following the battle, his official analysis best\\r\\ncaptured the essence of the struggle:\\r\\n\\r\\n  There was no hope of surprise, either strategic or tactical.\\r\\n  There was little possibility for tactical initiative; the entire\\r\\n  operation was fought on what were virtually the enemy’s own\\r\\n  terms.... The strength, disposition, and conduct of the enemy’s\\r\\n  defense required a major penetration of the heart of his prepared\\r\\n  positions in the center of the Motoyama Plateau and a subsequent\\r\\n  reduction of the positions in the difficult terrain sloping to the\\r\\n  shore on the flanks. The size and terrain of the island precluded\\r\\n  any Force Beachhead Line. It was an operation of one phase and one\\r\\n  tactic. From the time the engagement was joined until the mission\\r\\n  was completed it was a matter of frontal assault maintained with\\r\\n  relentless pressure by a superior mass of troops and supporting\\r\\n  arms against a position fortified to the maximum practical extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe Americans of a subsequent generation in the profession of arms find\\r\\nit difficult to imagine a sustained amphibious assault under such\\r\\nconditions. In some respects the fighting on Iwo Jima took on the\\r\\nfeatures of Marines fighting in France in 1918, described by one as\\r\\n“a war girt with horrors.” We sense the drama repeated every morning\\r\\nat Iwo, after the prep fires lifted, when the riflemen, engineers,\\r\\ncorpsmen, flame tank crews, and armored bulldozer operators somehow\\r\\nfound the fortitude to move out yet again into “Death Valley” or “The\\r\\nMeatgrinder.” Few of us today can study the defenses, analyze the\\r\\naction reports, or walk the broken ground without experiencing a sense\\r\\nof reverence for the men who won that epic battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleet Admiral Nimitz said these words while the fighting still\\r\\nraged: “Among the Americans who served on Iwo Jima, uncommon valor\\r\\nwas a common virtue,” a sentiment now chiseled in granite at the\\r\\nbase of Felix de Weldon’s gigantic bronze sculpture of the Suribachi\\r\\nflag-raising.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty-two Marines, four Navy corpsmen, and one LCI skipper were\\r\\nawarded the Medal of Honor for utmost bravery during the battle of Iwo\\r\\nJima. Half were posthumous awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Erskine placed these sacrifices in perspective in remarks\\r\\nmade during the dedication of the 3d Marine Division cemetery on the\\r\\nembattled island:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Victory was never in doubt. Its cost was. What was in doubt, in all\\r\\n  our minds, was whether there would be any of us left to dedicate\\r\\n  our cemetery at the end, or whether the last Marine would die\\r\\n  knocking out the last Japanese gunner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidebar (page 50): Above and Beyond the Call of Duty\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty-seven men received the Congressional Medal of Honor for\\r\\nconspicuous gallantry and intrepidity during the battle of Iwo Jima:\\r\\n22 Marines, four Navy corpsmen, and one Navy landing craft commander.\\r\\nExactly half of the awards issued to Marines and corpsmen of the\\r\\nV Amphibious Corps were posthumous.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
